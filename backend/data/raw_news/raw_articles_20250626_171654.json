    "summary": "SEUNGKWAN worried that the messages would \"be a bit safe\" — they were anything but.",
    "content": "Say what?! SEVENTEEN sat down for a round of hilarity when members SEUNGKWAN, THE 8, VERNON and MINGYU did BuzzFeed Celeb’s popular “Thirst Tweets” series — and the guys couldn’t help but lovingly roast each other during the segment posted Wednesday (June 25). Related SEVENTEEN Achieves Seventh No. 1 on Top Album Sales Chart With 'HAPPY BURSTDAY' 06/12/2025 Before getting started, MINGYU admitted to his fellow bandmates, “I thought it would be fun from the moment I heard we were doing this,” with SEUNGKWAN chiming in, “You know, we’ve heard a lot of thirst comments from fans over the years, so I’m hoping some of them go a bit bold. I’m excited to see just how much they’ll make us laugh.” While the fan messages did make the guys laugh, a lot of it was thanks to their ribbing of each other and themselves. The fun all started with the first tweet, which suggested “f–k” the puppy interview SEVENTEEN did in 2022, with the fan noting that “Thirst Tweets” is where it’s at. And they weren’t wrong. “It might be my first time saying ‘f–k’ on camera,” admitted SEUNGKWAN, before offering a tip to viewers. “We also have a song called ‘FML,’ so please have a listen to it.” When Vernon read a fan tweet that THE 8’s “angelic pastel mullet” and “thick, soft neck” reminded one of “a sexy My Little Pony,” MINGYU chimed in, “Like the donkey from Shrek ? You know — Donkey!” There were also a lot of tweets regarding how handsome fans think the guys of SEVENTEEN are (with several messages about SEUNGKWAN’s high cheekbones and strong jawline, which he reveled in), which led to some ribbing. Read MINGYU: “His hairline is perfect, his skin is glowing, his cheeks are plumpy, his fangs are pretty, his smile is mesmerizing, his mole nose is kissable his curved-up lips are to die for. Mingyu is just perfect.” He followed that up by asking his bandmates whether they agreed, and Vernon was quick to answer with an emphatic “No!” SEUNGKWAN — who had delicately traced MINGYU’s lips with his fingertip while the tweet was being read — turned and asked him, “Everything is natural?” When MINGYU answered in the affirmative, SEUNGKWAN didn’t seem so sure. “Really?!” he responded in disbelief, at which point, his bandmate told him to “STFU,” causing SEUNGKWAN to cover his mouth in mock horror as he repeated the expletive. But it didn’t end there. When one fan’s tweet suggested that THE 8 could “spit on me and push me into a wall and I’d thank him,” the guys made fun of his actual strength — or lack there of, apparently. “He probably won’t be able to push you — he’s not that strong,” VERNON joked, with MINGYU landing a final blow: “When he pushes, maybe he’d be like, ‘Whoa!’ and bounce back himself.” By the end, SEUNGKWAN admitted that he was a little worried the tweets they’d get would “be a bit safe,” but was glad they turned out to be “really funny.” Watch the full “Thirst Tweets” interview with SEVENTEEN above. The band is currently celebrating its 10th anniversary, releasing fifth studio album HAPPY BURSTDAY on May 26. The album peaked at No. 2 on the all-genre Billboard 200 on the chart dated June 16.",

And it is enchanting.” The Bridgerton star singled out one scene in the trailer in particular, of “Cynthia and Ariana on a pink swing floating in the air” as a scene he was particularly excited to watch. But when Fallon pressed him for details on what looked like a wedding between his character and Grande’s Glinda, Bailey kept his lips sealed. “Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. I don’t marry and tell,” he said with a smirk. Bailey’s not the only actor from the upcoming movie who’s excited to watch the final product. In Billboard ‘s June cover story , Erivo told Pride editor Stephen Daw that her character, Elphaba, gets to “access her rage more” in the new film, adding that “she is delicious in this next one.” Elsewhere during his Tonight Show interview, Bailey also reacted to the internet’s obsession with the eyewear he sports in his new film Jurassic World Rebirth , as fans have referred to his “ slutty little glasses ” as often as possible. “He’d be so proud to be called ‘slutty,'” he said of his character, before adding that the spectacles were a nod to the star of Steven Spielberg’s Jaws , Richard Dreyfuss.

    "content": "It’s midyear season at Billboard , with our 50 best albums and 50 best songs of the year so far going live earlier this week. Now that we’re about halfway through the 2025 calendar, it also seemed like a good time to look back on the year so far in pop stardom — who’s excelled, who’s disappointed, who’s been surprisingly invisible and who could still come back in a big way to define 2025 by year’s end. On this week’s Greatest Pop Stars podcast , host Andrew Unterberger is joined by the three Billboard staffers (Kyle Denis, Meghan Mahar and Jason Lipshutz) who appeared back in January to participate in our first-ever Greatest Pop Stars Fantasy Draft , where the four of us each drafted our own teams of pop stars who we thought would go on to define 2025. In this episode, we each revisit our rosters, and size up how each of our pop stars has done so far — and also talk about who’s leading the 2025 race in general, and predict some artists who might still enter the discussion before year’s end. Along the way, of course, we ask all the most important questions about the first six months in 2025 pop stardom: Why does 2025 still feel so much like an extension of 2024? Does the success of “Nokia” excuse drafting Drake over Kendrick Lamar? Where is Harry Styles? Did Bruno Mars secretly release his best song in a decade with a one-minute baile funk one-off no one seems to know about? Is Sabrina Carpenter coming back to run s–t? Is Cardi B? And perhaps most importantly — where does Benson Boone fit into all of this? Check it out above, and subscribe to the Greatest Pop Stars podcast on Apple Music or Spotify (or wherever you get your podcasts ) for weekly discussions every Thursday about all things related to pop stardom!

The theme song — which will be released digitally Friday via Walt Disney Records — introduces the new show’s main characters, as Hoppus sings, “It’s totally awesome when I’m with my best friends/ It’s better than chocolate, it’s better than weekends.” Related Mark Hoppus Reflects on Blink-182 vs. Green Day Rivalry During 2002 Tour 05/20/2025 The series follows supergenius besties Stark (Iron Man), Riri Williams (Ironheart) and Amadeus Cho (Iron Hulk) “as they work together to solve problems, both big and small, and protect their city,” according to the show announcement. Each of the kid heroes (voiced by Mason Blomberg, Kapri Ladd and Aidyn Ahn) has his or her own Iron Suit that lets them fly and gives them “enhanced super-strength.” Other voice actors in the new series include Veep star Tony Hale as Ultron, Saturday Night Live alum Vanessa Bayer as Swarm, and Talon Warburton (son of Seinfeld star Patrick Warburton) as Absorbing Man. Marvel’s Iron Man and his Awesome Friends premieres Aug. 11 on Disney Jr. at 8:30 a.m. ET/PT and the first 10 episodes will hit Disney+ and Disney Jr. On Demand the next day. As part of Grammy-nominated pop-punk band blink-182, Hoppus has scored three No. 1 albums on the all-genre Billboard 200 over his three-decade career: 2001’s Take Off Your Pants and Jacket , 2016’s California and, the group’s most recent project, 2023’s One More Time… They also have five No. 1 hits on Billboard ‘s Alternative Airplay chart, starting with 1999’s “All the Small Things” and most recently spending 20 weeks atop the list with 2023’s “One More Time.” Hoppus’ theme song follows in the footsteps of fellow alternative radio hitmaker Patrick Stump, lead singer of Fall Out Boy , crafting the theme song and additional music for Marvel’s Spidey and His Amazing Friends , which premiered in 2021 on Disney Jr. Listen to “Totally Awesome” below:",

    "summary": "Prime Country with Scotty McCreery will see singer highlighting his favorite country hits and deep cuts from the 1980s and 1990s.",
    "content": "Scotty McCreery has posted five Billboard Country Airplay chart-toppers during his career, including a streak of signature hits such as “Damn Strait” and “In Between.” But now, he’s gearing up to shine a spotlight on many of the hits, and album cuts, that have inspired him. On Thursday (June 26), McCreery was announced as the host of a new monthly show on SiriusXM’s Prime Country (Channel 58), which highlights country music of the 1980s and 1990s. Prime Country With Scotty McCreery will premiere Saturday, July 5 at 3 p.m. ET, with new episodes premiering the first Saturday of every month at 3 p.m. ET on Prime Country. Each show will also be rebroadcast on the channel several times throughout the month. “I love country music from every decade, but the country music of the ’80s and ’90s is probably my favorite era of music. I’m excited to put a spotlight on the songs and performers I grew up listening to that helped shape the artist I am today,” McCreery tells Billboard in a statement. He notes that the debut episode will feature music from artists including Garth Brooks, George Strait, Randy Travis, Kathy Mattea, Patty Loveless, Keith Whitley, Ronnie Milsap and John Anderson. “Each song is handpicked by me,” he says. “I’ll be sharing stories of how an artist influenced me or how I met them or something we may have experienced together on the road or backstage at an awards show or the Opry.” Even when McCreery made his career debut on American Idol (he won the talent competition’s 10th season), his allegiance to ’80s and ’90s country music was clear in his performances of songs such as Travis Tritt’s “Can I Trust You With My Heart” and Strait’s “I Cross My Heart.” His three-week Country Airplay No. 1 hit “Damn Strait” also nods to the Country Music Hall of Famer. McCreery was inducted as a member of the Grand Ole Opry in April 2024, when he was ushered into Opry membership by fellow country music hitmaker Josh Turner. McCreery is using his new show to highlight his passion for the Grand Ole Opry and its essential contributions to country music’s history and present-day global influence. “Every month I’ll also be sharing a live Opry performance that was recorded on that legendary stage during the ‘80s or ‘90s. My first episode will feature Joe Diffie performing ‘Pick Up Man’ on the Opry stage from Oct. 18, 1997,” McCreery previews. Of course, McCreery fans can also hear a few songs from McCreery himself. “You’ll also hear one or two of my songs on the show because – hey! It’s my show! I’m hoping in the future to occasionally have guest artists join me for some conversation as well. I’m really pumped to be able to do this and I appreciate SiriusXM offering me this opportunity. I hope people tune in and enjoy it!”",

    "content": "Singer-songwriter Blake Whiten has signed with Enchntmnt/Warner Records, Billboard can reveal. The South Carolina native is celebrating the signing by making his major label debut single release with “Made For Goodbyes.” Whiten launched his career by putting out cover performances on social media, with his version of Morgan Wallen’s “I Guess” earning over 9 million TikTok views. From there, he began releasing his own music, including the independent releases “Rollin’ Stone” and “Breakin’ My Heart.” He’s also a co-writer on Bailey Zimmerman’s 2024 song “Holding On,” which cracked the top 40 on Billboard’s Hot Country Songs chart. Related The 50 Best Songs of 2025 So Far (Staff Picks) 06/25/2025 Earlier this year, Whiten released his EP Six Mile and the single “Carolina,” both a nod to his hometown of Six Mile in South Carolina. He performed during CMA Fest and opened shows for Waylon Wyatt. This September, he’ll rise from opening act to headliner on his first U.S. tour. “I’m just a small town boy from Six Mile who picked up a guitar and started writing my own story,” Whiten said in a statement. “Now I’m a part of the amazing Warner Records family and one step closer to playing the music I love on the biggest stages. This is just the beginning, let’s make some noise!” Aaron Bay-Schuck , co-chairman & CEO, Warner Records, said in a statement, “Blake Whiten is a prime example of the type of artist we pride ourselves on signing at Warner Records. He possesses raw talent, distinct vocals, real musicianship and an impeccable knack for storytelling. We couldn’t be happier to welcome him to the Warner family and look forward to working closely with Enchntmnt to set Blake up for a long-lasting career.” “Blake Whiten is the kind of artist who reminds you why you get into this business in the first place. We’re proud to stand beside him and partner with Warner Records, a team that shares our vision and belief in true artist development. This isn’t just about music, it’s about legacy, and we’re just getting started” added Enchntmnt’s team of Reid Daroff, Benny “Brisk” Negrin and Alix Negrin .

    "content": "AI music company Suno recently acquired WavTool, a browser-based digital audio workstation (DAW). Though this deal, Suno has brought WavTool’s advanced editing capabilities and core team into the company where they will now hold product and engineering leadership roles. The news comes after a busy month for Suno. Just weeks ago, Billboard announced that Suno was releasing a number of new editing tools — including a stem extractor, song editor, extended uploads and “creative sliders” — to allow users more control over the song creation process. Now, with its acquisition of WavTool, Suno is further committing to becoming a product that is not just for novices who want songs at the click of a button but also one that can accommodate the needs of a more skilled musician as well. Related 5 Reasons Why AI Licensing Deals Between Major Labels and Suno and Udio Will Be Hard to… 06/03/2025 That same week, Bloomberg broke the news that Suno — and its competitor Udio — were in talks with the three major music companies about creating a licensing structure for songs in their training datasets after the three majors sued them last summer. The news set the music industry ablaze, frustrating some of their licensed AI music competitors and causing many to wonder what such a deal could even look like . Just yesterday, Udio also announced its expansion into the world of professional music tools. It introduced Sessions, their AI-powered visual workstation which is designed to provide an intuitive interface for users looking to have more control over the AI model’s outputs. “We’re finding that many of Suno’s early adopters are professional songwriters and producers who are seeing immense value in integrating AI into their creative process,” says Mikey Shulman , CEO and co-founder of Suno. “Our ultimate goal is to empower musicians, build tools that amplify human creativity and open up access to making great music. By bringing in WavTool’s elite DAW technology, and their team of experts, we’re in a position to better deliver on our mission.” Related Deezer Exec Says 'There's No Going Back' on AI Music: 'The Industry Will Need to Make… 06/24/2025 “Once we came to understand how Sunooperates, and how aligned the Suno team is with our vision for AI in the music creation process, we knew joining forces was the right move,” says Sam Watkinson , co-founder and former CEO of WavTool. “It’s a great privilege to be part of a team with such deep passion for music and a shared commitment to advance the future of music production – I can’t wait to show off what we’ve been building together.”",

    "link": "https://www.billboard.com/pro/kobalt-partners-chordal-global-sync-licensing/",
    "summary": "This marks Kobalt's first use of a third-party platform for global sync transactions.",
    "content": "In the world of music sync, where the complexities of rights management often stifle creativity and delay transactions, the newly announced partnership between Kobalt Music and Chordal offers a glimpse into what the future could look like. Kobalt, a leading independent music publisher, is integrating Chordal’s music rights technology as the enterprise sync platform for its catalog of over one million songs. The collaboration marks the first time Kobalt has relied on a third-party platform to power its global sync transactions, signaling an important shift in how music rights and licenses are handled in an increasingly digital world. Related How Licensing Deals Are Changing the Major Label World — And the Industry's Future 03/10/2025 “This partnership with Kobalt is a defining moment — not just for Chordal, but for the future of music licensing,” said Grayson Sanders , CEO of Chordal, in a statement. “Kobalt has long been at the forefront of modernizing rights management and we’re honored to help advance their mission to benefit creators worldwide.” For decades, music licensing — particularly for fractionally owned songs — has been mired in inefficiencies. Rights conflicts, time-consuming paperwork and tedious approval processes have made licensing music a slow and frustrating endeavor. Chordal’s new technology, particularly its licensing system InstantClear, introduced in March, aims to change all that. A key part of this partnership is InstantClear, a pre-cleared licensing system designed to streamline the process for songs that have multiple rights holders. Traditionally, coordinating approvals for these works has been arduous, often stalling deals before they are finalized. InstantClear facilitates key aspects of licensing and payments, allowing various rights holders to quickly approve their respective shares and supporting automated, custom legal contracts. Rob Christensen , executive vp and head of global sync at Kobalt, praised the versatility the partnership brings. “Chordal’s platform seamlessly integrates the creative and operational sides of the sync business, and their ability to consolidate rights holders on fractionally owned songs and masters greatly simplifies the process for buyers,” he said in a statement. In addition to streamlining operations, Christensen highlighted Chordal’s creative tools, which he described as “game changers” for music supervisors and creatives seeking music for projects. Related Is the Music Business Out of Synch With Game Developers? 03/12/2024 This collaboration also highlights the broader shift in rights management as the music business embraces innovative technologies. Kobalt’s integration with Chordal’s API enables music supervisors, producers and brands to access Kobalt’s catalog in real time, meaning buyers can quickly license music without long waits for clearance. Importantly, Sanders and Christensen emphasize that the partnership doesn’t aim to take control away from creators but rather to empower them. Kobalt writers and artists will have “the final say over where their music is used and at what price point,” Christensen said. Chordal’s presence has grown steadily in recent years, attracting major publishers and labels such as Reservoir Media, Believe and Primary Wave to its platform. With $4.5 million raised, the company has worked with clients since 2023 after beginning work on the platform in 2019.",

But there’s one very “Popular” singer that the Only Murders in the Building star says she wants to collaborate with next. In a new video for Complex , Gomez sat down with Latin superstar Karol G to discuss their GOATs (that’s “greatest of all times,” for the uninitiated), from the GOAT parties they’ve been to, the GOAT meals they’ve eaten and more. In one question, the pair were asked to name the “GOAT artist you’ve collaborated with” — but when Gomez insisted she didn’t “want to insult anyone,” Karol flipped the script and asked her to name the artist she most wants to collaborate with. After taking a moment to deliberate, Gomez came up with her answer: Ariana Grande . “I don’t know, she’s … I love her era.” It’s far from the first time Gomez has shown love to the Wicked star. Back in May, Gomez shared a post on her Instagram Stories praising the “Yes, And?” singer for her camaraderie throughout their careers. “I’m reminded that women can always be supportive of each other,” she wrote. “I love you, Ari.” Grande, meanwhile, sang Gomez’s praises during their respective awards season campaigns, saying, “I really love watching this moment happen for Selena. I know how hard she’s worked and how long she’s waited.” Elsewhere in their interview, Gomez and Karol G also had a lively conversation about the “GOAT bad b—h anthem,” with the Emilia Perez actress initially at a loss, because “there’s so many bad b—hes.” Gomez ultimately picked Destiny’s Child’s “Bills Bills Bills,” while Karol selected Ciara’s “Like a Boy.” Watch Selena Gomez and Karol G’s full discussion above.",

    "content": "Nintendo has patched Mario Kart World with an apparently small change to the way courses are selected in online lobbies. But the change has infuriated players who were already frustrated with the style of racing in the first open-world Mario Kart game. In short: By changing the way the “random” option works when voting on the next course to play, Nintendo has made it impossible to guarantee that the next course will be a three-lap circuit race, in traditional Mario Kart style. In doing so, it has pushed players even more firmly toward the unpopular “intermission” races, which feature a cross-country drive to the chosen circuit followed by, usually, a single lap at the destination. Mario Kart World ’s main online mode is ranked online lobbies. They way they work is that, after completing a race, everyone can muck around in free roam for a minute while voting on where to race next. Three options are presented, and they’re all adjacent tracks to the one that’s just been raced — so they’re all options for “intermission races” that include the drive to the next location. Alternatively, you can pick “random.” If it won the vote, this option would teleport everyone to another circuit somewhere else on the map, where they would participate in a “normal” three-lap race. Prior to the patch, the random option had become overwhelmingly popular due to players’ distaste for intermission races, which tend to involve more straight-line driving along freeways, dealing with hazards, and less technical cornering. Post-patch, the random option can pick from the three offered “intermission” races as well as teleporting players somewhere else — and seems weighted to pick the intermission races quite often. There’s no longer a way for players to vote for a guaranteed three-lap circuit. Polygon has asked Nintendo for comment on the reasoning behind this change. But it certainly seems as though Nintendo, in defiance of players’ wishes, is doubling down on the way the developers want Mario Kart World be played, with players progressing organically from point to point around the world map. Nintendo is so committed to this playstyle that you can easily play Mario Kart World for dozens of hours without ever encountering three-lap versions of many of the tracks. (You can choose them as an option when setting up Vs. mode races, and when racing in friends-only lobbies.) And now the developer has made it even rarer to encounter this kind of race online.",

    "content": "The next freebie on the Epic Games Store is not just worth your time — it’ll also respect your time. Sable , an open-world exploration game developed by Shedworks and released in 2021, is free now until July 3 and offers a desert to explore from the air-conditioned confines of your own home. Sable first caught my attention not through its gameplay, but through its soundtrack. Composed by Japanese Breakfast , Sable’s music is full of extremely chill and calming bops, making it the perfect music for writing. After listening to it too many times to count and buying it on vinyl, I figured at some point I needed to check out the game behind the music and dove into Sable myself. What I found is an open world, exploration-focused journey that allows you to enjoy it for as long or as little as you want. You play as Sable, a young woman who leaves her village to search for and discover what type of life she wants to live. Those answers come in the form of masks. Everyone in the desert world of Sable wears a mask, and those masks exemplify what a person does; some of the masks Sable can acquire include the cartographer’s mask, the machinist’s mask, and the guard’s mask. While the majority of the masks are purely cosmetic, they’re so much more important than just a new style of headgear for Sable; they represent the possible paths her life may take her. Exploration is the main draw of Sable , and exploring its world rewards you with some of the more fun masks. You’ll find the sandwyrm mask after trudging through the dead husk of a sandwyrm, like you’re Boba Fett taking an afternoon stroll through the Sarlacc pit (except Sable doesn’t have to worry about being swallowed and digested). The orange dome of the whale ship mask is earned through exploring the hulls and wreckages of spaceships scattered around the world of Sable . While climbing rocks and canyons is fun, nothing beats wandering about a derelict ship, making those exploration sections some of my favorites. The game relies on environmental storytelling, not explicitly stating to whom those spaceships belonged or what happened to their people, though audio recordings found deep within the ships offer hints. Sable grants you the freedom to explore at your own pace. You’ll spend most of the game flying about on Sable’s customizable glider , and the pastel colors and excellent shading of the planet will make you feel like you’re in a comic illustrated by Moebius. The visuals, working in conjunction with the game’s music, offer Sable and its world a personality that many open-world games — and their same-same forests or cities — don’t have. Perhaps what makes Sable so inviting is its ability to offer you a conclusion at any time. Once Sable has acquired a mask, you can return to her village and initiate the conclusion to her story. Maybe you want her to be a merchant, one of the easier masks to obtain early on, and are ready to leave the world of Sable . Or maybe you want to collect every mask Sable has to offer. There are some puzzles to solve and standard video game quests to complete, but the bulk of Sable — and the bulk of its appeal — is about enjoying the little moments that comprise its player-guided journey. The game respects your time and will allow you to finish it when you want, meaning you can snag it for free without consigning it to join your ever-growing backlog. Sable is available for PS5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S",

You can also change the porter suits Sam wears. While the game gives you some fixed patterns, you can customize the suit’s color. Here’s how to change your suit color in Death Stranding 2 . How to unlock changing suit colors in Death Stranding 2 To unlock the option to paint your porter suit, you need to complete the “009 Deliver the Chiral Decontaminator to the Government’s Base” mission . You’ll receive this assignment at the beginning of Episode 3 as you start to connect Australia to the Chiral network. Be prepared, as this mission requires you to traverse a long distance and pass through areas filled with BTs. Get to The Government’s Base and deliver the cargo to Old Oz to finish the mission. Although completing the 009 mission unlocks the painting option, you only formally learn about it during the briefing of the next mission, the “010 [Elimination] Liberate the Western Environmental Observatory from the Brigands” order. How to change suit color in Death Stranding 2 You can change your suit color by using the Customize Look menu after unlocking the function. While you have more than one suit pattern to wear in the game, in our experience, you can only change the color of the normal suit . Select the normal suit and the option to change its color will appear. Unlocking the painting suit function gives you some colors to choose from, but you can increase the list options by raising your Connection Level with the Artist, a character you’ll meet in Mexico. There are three ways to access the Customize Look menu: During the Final Preparations screen, before heading out to complete your next assignment At a Delivery Terminal , via a menu in the “Fabrication and Management” section Whenever you’re in a private room , by interacting with your suit hanging on the wall and choosing the “Customize Look” option.",

    "content": "[ Ed. note: This review contains minor spoilers for the first three episodes of Ironheart season 1.] Ironheart , Marvel’s spinoff of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever , has more in common with Isaac Asimov’s Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? than any MCU fan might guess. The existential question at hand: Can a machine truly feel or be human? In the Disney Plus series, the young, Tony Star-esque hero Riri Williams resurrects her best friend Natalie through artificial intelligence. The implications go full galaxy-brain real quick. Natalie can speak, remember, project a lifelike holographic form, and engage with people just like a real human — but she’s not “alive” in the traditional sense. While the idea of an artificial companion has long been a sci-fi staple, its real-world counterpart now comes with intense controversy. The newest forms of generative AI chatbots are poised to upend industries, eliminate jobs, and spread misinformation. Hollywood has responded awkwardly. Films like 2023’s The Creator and Jennifer Lopez’s run-and-gun Netflix action movie Atlas reflect a growing trend of pro-AI narratives from studios with major investments in the technology and a vested interest in its acceptance. Ironheart is another stab at improving the tech’s image. What bothers me isn’t that viewers might watch the Marvel show and retreat to their computers to form a bond with a ChatGPT-fueled human replica, it’s that people already are doing it for their deceased loved ones . Ironheart , which one imagines Disney designed for mass audience and appeal, doesn’t grapple with that present. A few years before the events of the show, Riri witnessed a drive-by shooter kill her father and best friend. Riri, still processing those deaths, is implementing an AI interface in her suit when, after she falls asleep during the process, Natalie’s digital counterpart is born through a cybernetic glitch while the protagonist is dreaming of her deceased best friend. At first, she’s scared and apprehensive of a computer taking the form of Natalie. But as time goes on, the AI Natalie becomes a coping mechanism for Riri to come to terms with the murders, an event that led her to create her first suit as a means of protection. Although Riri is painfully aware that the Natalie she’s mourning is dead and that she is in the presence of her AI counterpart, it’s still a mechanism that helps Riri cope with her death and eventually heal from it. None of this feels out of the realm of possibility. Chicago drive-bys take place much too often in real life, and ChatGPT is as easy to use as text messaging. But it’s a dark path for Marvel to casually Disneyify. There are already cases of people texting ChatGPT as if they’re friends , reports of teens and adults alike suffering delusions and coming to ChatGPT for answers or guidance. Facing mounting regret from those who have turned to AI for closure, OpenAI has had to admit to the fallacies of its own creation. Earlier this year, in an email to The Star , the company said it recognizes that “ChatGPT can feel more responsive and personal than prior technologies, especially for vulnerable individuals […] We’re working to understand and reduce ways ChatGPT might unintentionally reinforce or amplify existing, negative behavior.” Generative AI certainly has a place in society, particularly when it’s used to reduce menial labor, assist rather than replace, or even support the pursuit of justice. In a groundbreaking case reported by local outlet ABC 15 , an Arizona family used an AI-generated version of their deceased loved one to deliver his own victim impact statement in court. Chris Pelkey, a 37-year-old Army veteran and avid fisherman, was killed in a suspected road rage incident on Nov. 13, 2021. Rolling Stone reports this marks the first known instance of AI being used to deliver a victim impact statement in a U.S. court. Ultimately, Riri intends to use her suit to serve justice, and if AI is a tool that makes the job easier and more efficient, it’s hard to argue its usefulness. But it isn’t a Swiss Army knife that can fix the human condition. Later in Ironheart , Riri’s mother meets Natalie and, upon learning she’s an AI, engages her in conversation, astonished by how accurately Riri was able to “capture her spirit.” I found it hard to suspend disbelief that a grieving mother would so readily accept and interact with a digital replica. But since this is the MCU, it’s the kind of leap that’s easy to overlook. That same night, Riri’s mother asks if she could create an AI version of her late husband. Riri replies that she can’t, she doesn’t know how, but admits that if she could, she would. Riri, the scientific mind behind the AI, understands its boundaries and potential risks, while her mother, lacking that expertise, is emotionally vulnerable to what feels real. But even one of the smartest characters in the current Marvel Cinematic Universe ends up falling for the allure of having her best friend back, despite knowing better. That’s not hero behavior; it’s a sign of someone going through grief. Something that a conversation, relatability, or logic can’t cure. But if it was a crutch for someone as brilliant as Riri to lean against, what’s stopping someone from believing AI couldn’t do the same for them?",

    "content": "When you start Persona 5: The Phantom X , you’ll be tasked with naming the protagonist by writing down your name on a worksheet fairly early. If you’ve played Persona games before, you may be familiar with the protagonists’ “official” names from the series, and want to use the canon name for this game, too. Lucky for you, the canon name should have been filled in already, but if you accidentally deleted it or you don’t know if this is the real deal, then we explain more about the P5X protagonist’s canon name below. What’s the protagonist’s canon name in Persona 5: The Phantom X? In Japanese, the canon name for the Persona 5: The Phantom X protagonist is Nagisa Kamishiro . However , this doesn’t fit in the name slot for the English version of the game — so the canon name for the global version is Nagisa Kamisiro . Ultimately, you do not have to name your character Nagisa, of course. You can literally name him whatever you want. You can name him Zoo Smell, if you want. (Just make sure to change both his first name and last name, if you wanted to. We saw a lot of names in the beta where only the first name was changed, for some reason.) It should be noted that since this is a game with online friend capability, the name you set is your account name . You may want to pick something unique or you’ll be one Nagisa Kamisiro in an ocean of them. If you plan on adding a bunch of friends in-game, you may want to set your name as something your buddies can identify. That is all to say that “canon” has different definitions across the board. Persona protagonists have had varying names across media. For example, the Persona 4 protagonist is named Souji Seta in the manga, but Yu Narukami in Persona 4 Arena and the anime adaption. Similarly, the protagonist from Persona 5 was named Akira Kurusu in the manga adaption, but has canonically been referred to as Ren Amamiya, which was the default name in Persona 5 Royal . (Ren is fine, but to me he’ll always be Akira!) It’s entirely possible that Nagisa will appear elsewhere in other media with a different name, but we’re basing this off of the default name available to us in the beta that we played. Can you change the protagonist’s name in Persona 5: The Phantom X? Yes! If you went with Nagisa (or Zoo Smell, by our recommendation) and you’re regretting it, you can change your name for free once . After the first name change, you’ll need to pay 200 Meta Jewels (the premium currency that you can earn by playing the game) for every subsequent change. You can change your name by clicking your profile icon at the top of your phone screen menu, but only after you’ve progressed a bit in the story. From there, click the ellipses above your set icon to access the name change feature.",

    "content": "Contracts act as the gacha banners in Persona 5: The Phantom X and pulling on a contract banner is how you’ll unlock your favorite character and their iconic weapon. The banners in Persona 5: The Phantom X work similarly to other gacha titles like Honkai: Star Rail , Zenless Zone Zero , and Wuthering Waves , but there are a few notable differences. Below, we explain how the contract banner works in Persona 5: The Phantom X and what to expect when you pull on each banner. How contract banners work in Persona 5: The Phantom X Similar to other gacha games, Persona 5: The Phantom X uses a banner system where you’ll need to convert a premium currency into a ticket in order to pull on a banner. There are two premium currencies in Persona 5: The Phantom X , Meta Jewels and Cognition Crystals . Here’s what they do: Meta Jewels — Premium currency earned by completing story content, increasing social links, completing events, exchanging Violet Cognigems in the shop, and more. Cognition Crystals — Premium currency purchased in the shop with real money. (Keep in mind, you don’t need to spend money to be successful in Persona 5: The Phantom X .) To pull on a contract banner , you must first convert either premium currency into a contract banner’s respective ticket: Limited-time character contracts — Platinum Ticket Standard character contracts — Gold Ticket Newcomer contracts — Gold Ticket Weapon contracts — Platinum Milicoin For the character contracts , you’ll need to convert 150 of either premium currency to create one of the tickets. However, for the weapon contracts , you’ll only need to convert 100 of either premium currency to create the Platinum Milicoin. If you’d like to save some time, you can create 10 tickets or milicoins at once by converting 1,500 or 1,000 of either premium currency . Then, you can use your tickets or milicoins to pull for characters or weapons depending on the banner. For more information on each banner type and their contract rates, check out the sections below. Limited-time character contract banners Limited-time character contract banners work super similarly to other games with limited-time banners. This is where you’ll find the “Most Wanted” Phantom Idols like Joker/Ren Amamiya, but these banners will only stick around for a short amount of time. As for the gacha rates on the limited-time characters, the odds are as follows: 0.8% chance of receiving a five-star character 6.2% chance of receiving a four-star character 93% chance of receiving a two-star character 80 pulls to guarantee a five-star character 10 pulls to guarantee a four-star or higher character The first time you receive a five-star contract from the limited-time banner, there is a 50% chance you’ll receive the “Most Wanted” character, which is the promotional five-star character. If you were unlucky and received a different five-star character, you’re guaranteed to get the “Most Wanted” character as your next five-star contract . Standard character contract banners The standard character contract banner is similar to the limited-time contract banner, but it’s a permanent banner that does not feature any promotional characters. The gacha rates for the standard banner is as follows: 0.8% chance of receiving a five-star character 6.2% chance of receiving a four-star character 93% chance of receiving a two-star character 80 pulls to guarantee a five-star character 10 pulls to guarantee a four-star or higher character After you draw 300 contracts, you can choose one of the following five-star characters to permanently unlock: Ryuji Sakamoto Morgana Ann Takamaki Yaoling Li Haruna Nishimori Newcomer contract banner The newcomer contract banner is your standard beginner banner in other gacha games. To help you progress through the story, you can unlock a powerful five-star character at a much quicker pace through this banner. The gacha rates for this banner are as follows: 0.8% chance of receiving a five-star character 6.2% chance of receiving a four-star character 93% chance of receiving a two-star character 10 pulls to guarantee a four-star or higher character For the newcomer banner, you will only need to pay eight Gold Tickets to draw 10 contracts as opposed to the typical 10 Gold Tickets. Additionally, after you draw 50 contracts, you’ll unlock one five-star Phantom Thief of your choosing : Ryuji Sakamoto Morgana Ann Takamaki Weapon contract banners Weapon contract banners are where you’ll find powerful weapons to buff your characters. The weapon contract banners function similarly to the other banners except for the gacha rates and pity count. The gacha rates and pity counts are as follows: 0.8% chance of receiving a five-star weapon 8% chance of receiving a four-star weapon 91.2% chance of receiving a three-star weapon 70 pulls to guarantee a five-star weapon 10 pulls to guarantee a four-star or higher weapon Before you start drawing contracts, make sure to edit the weapon selections on the banner. You can select up to three weapons with the weapon in the first slot having a 50% chance to drop , while the other two weapons will both have a 25% chance to drop . If you don’t receive your primary weapon choice as the first five-star contract, you’re guaranteed to draw it on your next five-star contract.",

    "content": "The Mario movie. The Minecraft movie. The Borderlands movie. Jack Black is everywhere in pop gaming culture lately, and will even make another appearance (well, technically two) in next month’s Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 remake. Black will reprise his role as Officer Dick, in addition to voicing Constable Richard, Dick’s UK counterpart, in the game’s London level. As a child, Dick, real name Richard Ennvee, “was mocked by other skaters and called a ‘poser,’” according to an Activision press release. “Overtaken by the need for revenge, Dick vowed to one day become what those skaters feared most – the long arm of the law!” Although the good constable doesn’t get as much of a lore drop, he is promised to be “every bit as hard-nosed and utterly ridiculous as Officer Dick.” For those who don’t remember the officer from the older games, he’s been an unlockable character in the franchise since the original game, and remained as such until Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 . He returned in Tony Hawk’s Project 8 and Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater HD before making an appearance in Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2 as Jables himself. In Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 , Black joins Doom Slayer , TMNT’s Michelangelo , and Bam Margera among the roster of playable characters. No stranger to gaming (he was the lead in Double Fine’s 2009 hit Brütal Legend ), Jack Black has been a visible face in recent high-profile gaming-themed projects. He’s the voice of Bowser in the Mario movies , the voice of Claptrap in the box office bomb Borderlands , and the face of the billion-dollar live-action hit Minecraft . And this summer, he’ll make funky faces and jokes in a Tony Hawk game. Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4 is out July 11 for Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X.",

    "content": "[ Ed. note : This post contains spoilers for Act 2 of The Alters .] Just when I got my Jans into the clear and avoided death by irradiating sunrise in The Alters ’ very stressful first act , we were hit with yet another obstacle. And I’m not talking about the gravity distortions obstructing the Jans’ giant-wheel space base from advancing any further. Instead, they were staring down the barrel of doom via cloning-induced brain damage, and neither solution to the gray matter medical issue felt morally right — which made the quest all the more engaging. In The Alters , most of your time is spent assigning Jan Dolski’s alters — clones he produces with alternate timeline consciousnesses — to tasks like base maintenance, resource mining, and making sure there’s food on the table to quell any brewing rebellions. Sometimes you get objectives that are simply to not let any alters die. Tension is high when you’re marooned on a lifeless planet with only six alternate versions of yourself for company. But before Jan creates any of his alters, he clones a sheep to test the altering process. That sheep is Molly, the good girl who just chills in the Womb, the part of the base responsible for the biological aspect of the cloning procedure. Thankfully, you never have to worry about keeping her fed — there are enough things to keep track of as is — but you should give her lots of pets. Molly dies unexpectedly at the beginning of Act 2, setting off a questline that won’t end well for Jan prime, and certainly won’t be easy on you, the player. There are plenty of choices to be made in The Alters , but none made me rack my brain quite like figuring out how to keep Jan’s alters alive, happy, and (most importantly) not mad at me. After a sheep autopsy reveals every alter is in danger of the same fate that befell Molly, Jan seeks help from Maxwell, the shady figure who may or may not be capitalizing on Jan’s situation to further his own agenda (yeah, he’s definitely furthering his own agenda). Maxwell presents a solution that immediately made me feel icky to see through — healthy brain matter must be harvested to synthesize a cure, which means Jan would have to clone an alter but keep him sedated before his brain “activates,” and then kill him. That alter, dubbed Tabula Rasa, would be a sacrificial lamb, the “just one” option of the trolley problem. Because Tabula Rasa is spat out of the Womb as a fully formed body, the ethical quandary is immediate. That dude looks like Jan, and all the other Jans. He is a Jan, just one who isn’t “activated” yet with a consciousness, a personality, or memories. There’s a big difference between Jan sacrificing a human who looks just like him rather than, say, a brain in a jar. That’s Jan lying asleep on the table. And that Jan is going to die. Half your alters won’t be on board with this — the blank slate alter is still one of them, after all. They view Tabula Rasa as a brother, a member of this alternate timeline found family. Killing him would be like killing them. The other solution, offered by Jan prime’s ex-wife Lena, involves creating and implanting computer chips into the alters’ heads to save them. However, doing this would alert the big bad capitalist corporation AllyCorp to their existence, which is a big no-no; if anyone finds out about Jan’s illegally cloned and ethically questionable alters, it’s likely lights out for them — that, or they’ll be put under the corporation’s control. Both options made me feel quite queasy — there’s no binary good or bad, Paragon or Renegade choices here. Jan doesn’t get a morality meter to track if he’s being a decent or a shit human being. Instead, you and Jan have to sit with your choice, knowing not everyone will be happy with it — including even you! I too felt sacrificing Tabula Rasa would be like killing a part of this weird, argumentative family (who occasionally sings together). At the same time, exposing Jan’s alters to the corporation felt like guaranteed death or, perhaps worse, a lifetime of experiments and slave labor. I wish I could have kicked the can down the road on the decision, but The Alters doesn’t work like that. Its sun is always rising, ready to burn you to ash, and the Jans’ brain problem ain’t going away on its own. Despite learning just how shady Maxwell is — turns out he wants to run his own experiments on the Jans; who coulda guessed? — I elected to go with his blank-slate solution, 3D printing a Jan just to kill him. It felt gross, like I was killing a part of the character I had spent about 15 hours embodying, yet I felt that self-death was better than whatever AllyCorp would do to the Jans. Sacrificing Tabula Rasa at least gives the Jans a fighting chance, or at least that’s how I rationalized the decision. Regardless of which option you choose, things go south: The Jans are alive, but half the group won’t be happy, leading to a rebellion led by Jan Technician. Turns out our pierogi dinner could only bring us so close together, and killing Jan Tabula Rasa pushed us irreconcilably apart. Jan Technician and the unhappy Jans splinter off to try to survive on their own. Jan prime and the Jans who remain aren’t out of the woods yet. We have to figure out how to survive Act 3, rescue the rebellious Jans, and ensure we all make it off this rock while trying to brainstorm a way to hide the Jans from the “rescue team” coming to save them. The Alters never relents, throwing at you one moral dilemma after another, and I’m really curious how — or if , really — I’ll be able to get my Jans home to Earth alive without any more blood on our hands.",

    "content": "It’s been nearly a year since a faulty CrowdStrike update took down 8.5 million Windows-based machines around the world, and Microsoft wants to ensure such a problem never happens again. After holding a summit with security vendors last year, Microsoft is poised to release a private preview of Windows changes that will move antivirus (AV) and endpoint detection and response (EDR) apps out of the Windows kernel. The new Windows endpoint security platform is being built in cooperation with CrowdStrike, Bitdefender, ESET, Trend Micro, and many other security vendors. “We’ve had dozens of partners supply papers to us, some of them hundreds of pages long, on how they’d like it to be designed and what the requirements are,” explains David Weston, vice president of enterprise and OS security at Microsoft, in an interview with The Verge . “I’ve been really pleased with this. It’s an industry of competitors but everyone has stepped up and said we’ve got to build a platform that all of us work on.” Microsoft is keen to stress that it’s not setting the rules and expecting everyone to immediately follow them, but instead build the rules together. “We’re not here to tell them how the API should work, we’re here to listen and provide the security and reliability,” Weston says. “I think if we’d gone out that some of our competitors and said, ‘Here it is, take it or leave it,’ that would really be a challenge.” For decades, Microsoft has built Windows in a way that has allowed developers to deliver security software that’s deeply rooted into Windows, running at the kernel level of Windows — the core part of an operating system that has unrestricted access to system memory and hardware. The faulty CrowdStrike update last year highlighted just how easy it is for a kernel-level driver to go wrong and take down a machine, resulting in a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD). Microsoft now has some of its most knowledgeable Windows engineers working on these security changes. “We’ve had key developers on this, some of the kernel architects of Windows and people that don’t even traditionally work in security,” Weston says. “It’s really the biggest brains of core Windows being involved and collaborating with CrowdStrike, ESET, and all those folks.” The private preview will give security vendors a chance to request changes. Weston says he expects a few iterations until it’s ready for vendors to make the switch. It’s also not going to solve every single kernel-level driver instance straight away. “Our goal is to start with AV and EDR, but there will likely be kernel drivers for some period as we move on to the next set of use cases.” Another big area of Windows that uses kernel-level drivers is anti-cheating engines for games. Microsoft has been speaking with game developers about how to reduce the amount of kernel usage, but it’s a more complicated use case as cheaters often have to purposefully tamper with their machine to disable protections and get cheating engines running. “A lot of [game developers] would love to not have to maintain kernel stuff, and they are very interested in how they do that,” Weston says. “We’ve been talking about the requirements there, and I think we’ll have more to say on that in the near future.” Riot Games told me last year that it’s willing to follow potential Windows security changes and “recede from the kernel space.” While it’s going to take Microsoft and security vendors some time to work through these Windows changes, Microsoft is confident that it will see good adoption rates because its customers are asking for changes in the wake of the CrowdStrike incident. Microsoft is also getting ready to release a Windows update later this summer that will include a new Quick Machine Recovery feature, which is designed to quickly restore machines that can’t boot. It prompts a device to enter the Windows Recovery Environment, where the machine can access the network and provide Microsoft with diagnostic information. “We basically built the thing we’d love to have had for the incident last year,” Weston says. The sight of a Blue Screen of Death will also be a thing of the past, too. Microsoft is now officially redesigning its BSOD so that it’s black and not blue. More on that big change here .",

    "content": "Microsoft's \"This is an Xbox\" marketing campaign in November always felt a little too early. If you ask a friend or family member what an Xbox is, the response is likely going to be \"it's a game console.\" Xbox is ingrained in popular culture as a box under your TV that you play games on, but Microsoft's ads over the past six months have been attempting to redefine the Xbox as a platform that spans across phones, laptops, TVs, handheld gaming PCs, and even VR headsets. The ads did a great job of drawing attention to the platform, but the perception of the Xbox brand as just a console is still a huge challenge that Microsoft needs to overcome if its latest strategy is going to be successful. I can already sense some trouble ahead. Ever since Microsoft unveiled its ROG Xbox Ally handheld devices earlier this month, I keep hearing from friends that are asking about an \"Xbox handheld.\" YouTubers with millions of followers have positioned these handheld gaming PCs as \"the first Xbox handheld,\" which is true if you believe in Microsoft's marketing, but false in reality because they don't natively run Xbox games, only PC versions.

Microsoft revealed earlier this year that it was overhauling its BSOD error message in Windows 11, and the company has now confirmed that it will soon be known as the Black Screen of Death. The new design drops the traditional blue color, frowning face, and QR code in favor of a simplified black screen. The simplified BSOD looks a lot more like the black screen you’d see during a Windows update. But it will list the stop code and faulty system driver that you wouldn’t always see during a crash dump. IT admins shouldn’t need to pull crash dumps off PCs and analyze them with tools like WinDbg just to find out what could be causing issues. “This is really an attempt on clarity and providing better information and allowing us and customers to really get to what the core of the issue is so we can fix it faster,” says David Weston, vice president of enterprise and OS security at Microsoft, in an interview with The Verge . “Part of it just cleaner information on what exactly went wrong, where it’s Windows versus a component.” Microsoft says it will roll out this new BSOD design in an update to Windows 11 “later this summer,” alongside its new Quick Machine Recovery feature, which is designed to quickly restore machines that can’t boot. The changes to the BSOD are part of a broader effort by Microsoft to improve the resiliency of Windows in the wake of last year’s CrowdStrike incident, which left millions of Windows machines booting to a BSOD.",

    "content": "The new Insta360 Flow 2 offers up to 10 hours of battery life and can even be used to charge your phone. | Image: Insta360 Insta360 has announced a new version of its entry-level smartphone gimbal. The new Insta360 Flow 2 includes many of the upgrades introduced on the Insta360 Flow 2 Pro that launched earlier this year including multi person tracking and the ability to use the Apple Watch as a remote control. But you’re also going to lose useful features like the ability to use alternate camera apps, including the iPhone’s native one, by saving yourself $50. The original Flow launched in 2023 for $159.99 but has since dropped in price following the introduction of the company’s pro models. The new Insta360 Flow 2 is available now through the company’s online store and Amazon in stone grey and summit white color options for $109.99 on its own. It can also be purchased in a $129.99 bundle that includes Insta360’s AI Tracker accessory that handles subject tracking so you can use any smartphone camera app you prefer. For those who don’t need pro features the Flow 2 could be a more affordable alternative, but it’s still more expensive than DJI’s $89 Osmo Mobile 7 that launched last February. Like the pro version, the Insta360 Flow 2 features a built-in extending selfie stick, a set of short metal tripod legs so it can stand on its own, and up to 10 hours of use from its 1,100mAh battery which will be reduced when using the gimbal in handheld mode given it requires continuous stabilization. Using NFC the Flow 2 can automatically connect to smartphones over Bluetooth and launch the Insta360 app which features the company’s Deep Track 4.0 technology that can keep individual subjects or groups of people in frame, even when temporarily obstructed by things like passing cars. The app also features a new teleprompter feature that will automatically scroll a script while recording and tracking you. So what are you sacrificing by choosing the Flow 2 over the Flow 2 Pro and saving $50? The cheaper gimbal doesn’t have a selfie mirror on the back of the smartphone mount that lets you see yourself while recording selfie videos using a phone’s rear camera, and it doesn’t have the Pro’s glowing ring light that makes it easier to see when tracking is working. The Flow 2 also doesn’t have infinite 360-degree panning, so it can’t keep you in frame while you’re walking in circles around the gimbal. But the most notable omission is that it doesn’t support Apple’s DockKit framework which allows the Flow 2 Pro to track subjects using iOS’ native camera app and third-party alternatives. You’ll need to stick with Insta360’s app when using the Flow 2, or pay an extra $20 for the dedicated tracking add-on if you want to use your preferred camera app.",

    "content": "The BBC wants to make people in the US pay for its content. The public broadcaster announced on Thursday that it will start offering US-based users an $8.99 per month (or $49.99 per year) subscription for “unlimited” access to news stories, feature reports, and the BBC News channel livestream. Users in the US will still get free access to “select” breaking news stories, BBC Radio 4 and BBC World Service radio livestreams, BBC World Service sites, as well as newsletters and podcasts. BBC.com will use a “dynamic pay model” to show paywalls to certain readers depending on how much they read and how long they’re on the site. “This approach allows casual readers to explore freely, while offering our most engaged users the opportunity to unlock even more,” the BBC writes in its announcement. “By opting to pay, readers gain unlimited access to all the site’s content.” The BBC says its website reaches 60 million users in the US alone. The move is meant to help the BBC drum up more revenue as the money collected from yearly license fees in the UK — which people are required to purchase to watch live TV or use BBC iPlayer — continues to tumble . Last year, around 500,000 households in the UK canceled their license fee as more people turned to streaming services like Netflix. The UK government has considered trying new methods to support the BBC, including extending license fees to streaming-only users and radio listeners, as well as rolling out ads on the BBC and taxing streamers, according to Bloomberg . In the future, the BBC’s subscription will include ad-free documentary series, films, and podcasts, along with access to exclusive newsletters and other content. It notes that users based in the UK won’t experience any changes to how they access the BBC, as BBC.com will flag users based on their device’s geolocation. UK users who travel to the US can also continue to read or stream BBC content uninterrupted by accessing it through the BBC News app. The BBC notes that it currently doesn’t have plans to launch a subscription outside of North America.",

    "content": "First, Amazon MGM secured creative control of the James Bond IP . Then, it brought Amy Pascal and David Heyman in to produce a new feature about the iconic spy. Now, the studio has found a director to lead the project. Last night, Amazon MGM announced that Denis Villeneuve has been tapped to direct a new Bond film — the studio’s first since it obtained the property as part of its $8.45 billion acquisition of MGM back in 2021. The new Bond project does not yet have a name, casting details, or a production timeline, but Amazon MGM also shared that Tanya Lapointe is attached to produce. In a press release about his involvement in the new movie, Villeneuve said that as a longtime fan who grew up watching the Bond series, he sees the character as “sacred territory.” “Some of my earliest movie-going memories are connected to 007,” Villeneuve said. “I intend to honor the tradition and open the path for many new missions to come. This is a massive responsibility, but also, incredibly exciting for me and a huge honor.” Amazon MGM and Prime Video head Mike Hopkins echoed Villeneuve’s enthusiasm and said that it was an honor to be able to collaborate with him. Hopkins also seemed to indicate that the studio intends for the new project to receive a theatrical release. “From Blade Runner 2049 to Arrival to the Dune films, [Villeneuve] has delivered compelling worlds, dynamic visuals, complex characters, and—most importantly—the immersive storytelling that global audiences yearn to experience in theaters,” Hopkins said. “James Bond is in the hands of one of today’s greatest filmmakers and we cannot wait to get started on 007’s next adventure.” It’s likely going to be a while until we see any of the new Bond given how busy Villeneuve currently is with his work on a third Dune feature for Legendary and Warner Bros. Discovery, which is slated to hit theaters next year. As Deadline notes, Villeneuve has also reportedly been in talks to work on Universal’s upcoming Cleopatra project , Alcon Entertainment ‘s adaptation of Arthur C. Clarke’s Rendezvous with Rama , and Legendary’s adaptation of Annie Jacobsen’s Nuclear War: A Scenario . Bringing Villeneuve on for Bond seems like a solid move on Amazon’s part considering how much money the studio spent to buy MGM and then, as part of a separate deal, to convince longtime Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson to give up creative control of the IP. Villeneuve’s a known hit maker, and he might be able to help Amazon recoup a substantial chunk of its investment. But the new film’s success is undoubtedly going to hinge on its story and whoever ends up becoming the latest 007.",

    "content": "Intel is shutting down its business dedicated to making processors for cars. In a memo seen by The Oregonian , Intel tells workers that it plans to lay off “most” employees in the division, citing plans to shift focus to its “core client and data center portfolio.” “As part of this work, we have decided to wind down the automotive business within our client computing group,” Intel writes in the memo. “We are committed to ensuring a smooth transition for our customers.” Intel didn’t immediately respond to The Verge ’s request for comment. Over the years, Intel has invested heavily in its automotive business, which builds chips that power a car’s infotainment system, instrument clusters, and other controls. Intel’s technology runs in more than 50 million vehicles , and up until now, it seemed set on expanding its reach. Last year, it announced new AI-enhanced chips for cars that will help improve a vehicle’s navigation system and voice assistant. It revealed plans to bring its Arc GPU to cars as well. Intel also acquired the self-driving car technology company Mobileye for $15 billion in 2017. Mobileye later went public as a standalone company, but Intel still owns a majority stake. Intel’s newly appointed CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, said in April that the company would need to “reduce the size” of its workforce in the second quarter of 2025 as part of plans to get the chipmaker back on track. The company also informed employees of layoffs coming to its foundry business as well, according to The Oregonian , and a recent WARN (Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification) notice in California suggests layoffs impacting 107 employees at its Santa Clara headquarters.",

    "content": "Cables that support the HDMI 2.2 specification will include an Ultra96 label so they’re easier to identify. | Image: HDMI Forum After first announcing it at CES 2025 , the HDMI Forum is finally releasing the new HDMI 2.2 specification to manufacturers today. Although there is no definitive timeline for how long it will take hardware makers to adopt the new specification, the first Ultra96 HDMI Cables, with bandwidth capabilities boosted to up to 96Gbps, could be available later this year. HDMI 2.1 and the current Ultra High Speed HDMI cables have a maximum bandwidth of 48Gbps which supports resolutions up to 10K and refresh rates up to 120Hz with 4K content. HDMI 2.2 and the new Ultra96 cables will enable even higher resolutions and refresh rates including 4K at 480Hz, 8K at 240Hz, 10K at 120Hz, and even 16K at 60Hz. It will also handle uncompressed video formats with 10-bit and 12-bit color at 8K at 60Hz and 4K at 240Hz. Given how difficult it still is to find native 8K content, don’t expect cable providers or console makers to offer 16K anytime soon. HDMI 2.1 has been around since 2017 and hardware makers still don’t take full advantage of the spec, so the increased bandwidth and resolutions of 2.2 should help future-proof the HDMI specification for years to come. The HDMI Forum is also hoping that the new specification will make it easier for consumers to know what cable they need to be using. HDMI cables are currently differentiated with names including Standard, High Speed, Premium High Speed, and Ultra High Speed, which doesn’t provide any specifics on their capabilities. With HDMI 2.2, the Ultra96 name will make it clear that a cable supports the new specification and bandwidths up to 96Gbps. HDMI 2.2 will also include the new Latency Indication Protocol (LIP), which was also announced last January. The feature is designed to build on audio and video synchronization improvements introduced with HDMI 2.1, particularly for setups where signals are bouncing through a soundbar or an AV receiver before reaching a TV or projector. All cables supporting the HDMI 2.2 specification and featuring the Ultra96 label will be certified by the HDMI Forum’s authorized test centers to ensure they can handle the increased bandwidth. However, a device that’s Ultra96 certified won’t necessarily require a new HDMI cable if you don’t need the latest features. You can continue to use your existing older HDMI cables and even still take advantage of some HDMI 2.2 features that don’t require higher bandwidths. But if you want to upgrade your home theater to 16K, you will need to upgrade to Ultra96 cables. Update, June 26th: Added details about Ultra96 certification and backwards compatibility with older HDMI cables.",

    "content": "The Dell 14 Premium (left) and Dell 16 Premium (right) look just like their XPS forebears. After scrapping its XPS branding earlier this year, Dell has now launched two of the new “Premium” laptop models that are replacing it. Aside from being refreshed with Intel’s Core Ultra Series 2 Arrow Lake processors, a slightly revised Dell lid logo, and a few other spec changes, the Dell 16 Premium and Dell 14 Premium are nearly identical to the popular XPS 16 and XPS 14 that preceded them. “The new name signals a fresh chapter — one that makes it easier than ever to find the right PC while providing the same exceptional quality, design, and performance,” Dell’s product management lead, Kevin Terwilliger, said in the announcement blog . Both laptops are available now in the US and Canada, with prices starting at $1,649.99 ($2,649.99 Canadian) for the Dell 14 Premium and $2,699.99 ($3,749.99 Canadian) for the Dell 16 Premium . There are still two color options available — a silver “Platinum” shade and a darker gray “Graphite” — which carry on the XPS legacy of being bland enough to blend into the school, college, and office environments that these laptops are marketed for. The Dell 16 Premium has been bumped to the latest generation of Nvidia RTX laptop GPUs, with the RTX 5060 available at launch. Additional models sporting the RTX 5050, RTX 5070, and integrated Intel Arc graphics will also be launching “soon,” with pricing yet to be revealed. The RTX 5070-equipped model specifically will also benefit from an upgrade to Thunderbolt 5. The Dell 14 Premium retains integrated Intel graphics and the option to configure it with an RTX 4050 GPU, just as the 2024 Dell XPS 14, but it can now be configured with up to 64GB of LPDDR5 RAM compared to the previous 32GB maximum. It also now comes with Wi-Fi 7 support, bringing it in line with the XPS 16 and new Dell 16 Premium. Not much else seems to have changed. Specs for the display, ports, and storage mirror those offered on last year’s XPS 14 and 16 lineup, as does the overall design — including the gapless “zero-lattice” keyboard with capacitive touch function row that we found to be lacklustre compared to keyboards on other laptops like the older XPS 15 or current MacBook Pros.",

    "summary": "A mix of iron, chlorine, and lithium is conductive, stores lithium, and self-heals.",
    "content": "Battery electrode materials need to do a lot of things well. They need to be conductors to get charges to and from the ions that shuttle between the electrodes. They also need to have an open structure that allows the ions to move around before they reach a site where they can be stored. The storage of lots of ions also causes materials to expand, creating mechanical stresses that can cause the structure of the electrode material to gradually decay. Because it's hard to get all of these properties from a single material, many electrodes are composite materials, with one chemical used to allow ions into and out of the electrode, another to store them, and possibly a third that provides high conductivity. Unfortunately, this can create new problems, with breakdowns at the interfaces between materials slowly degrading the battery's capacity. Now, a team of researchers is proposing a material that seemingly does it all. It's reasonably conductive, it allows lithium ions to move around and find storage sites, and it's made of cheap and common elements. Perhaps best of all, it undergoes self-healing, smoothing out damage across charge/discharge cycles. Read full article Comments",

It was launched by a physicist who was somewhat skeptical of the work being done by climate scientists, but it has evolved into one of the key groups that does the math needed to track the planet's temperatures. For the past couple of years, those temperatures have seen a remarkable rise to record highs, at one point setting a yearlong string where every month set a record for the warmest instance of that month on record . The rise leaves us at risk of exceeding key climate targets much earlier than expected and has left the climate science community scrambling to explain the intensity of the heat. So we plan to ask Zeke a bit about what scientists are thinking about the dramatic nature of these changes, attempts to explore the relationship between temperatures, and things like tipping points and individual weather events. And all that leads to the key question: What does this tell us about where our climate is likely to go over the rest of this century? Read full article Comments",

The tracking was so reliable that Apple had to add anti-stalking features. And although there are just as many Android phones out there, Google's version of mobile device tracking, known as Find Hub, has been comparatively spotty. Now, Google is about to offer users a choice that could fix Bluetooth tracking on Android. According to a report from Android Authority , Google is preparing to add a new screen to the Android setup process. This change, integrated with Play Services version 25.24, has yet to roll out widely, but it will allow anyone setting up an Android phone to choose a more effective method of tracking that will bolster Google's network. This is included in the Play Services changelog as, \"You can now configure Find Hub when setting up your phone, allowing the device to be located remotely.\" Trackable devices like AirTags and earbuds work by broadcasting a Bluetooth LE identifier, which phones in the area can see. Our always-online smartphones then report the approximate location of that signal, and with enough reports, the owner can pinpoint the tag. Perhaps wary of the privacy implications, Google rolled out its Find Hub network (previously Find My Device) with harsh restrictions on where device finding would work. Read full article Comments",

    "summary": "Company hired Google's book-scanning chief to cut up and digitize \"all the books in the world.\"",
    "content": "On Monday, court documents revealed that AI company Anthropic spent millions of dollars physically scanning print books to build Claude , an AI assistant similar to ChatGPT . In the process, the company cut millions of print books from their bindings, scanned them into digital files, and threw away the originals solely for the purpose of training AI—details buried in a copyright ruling on fair use whose broader fair use implications we reported yesterday. The 32-page legal decision tells the story of how, in February 2024, the company hired Tom Turvey, the former head of partnerships for the Google Books book-scanning project, and tasked him with obtaining \"all the books in the world.\" The strategic hire appears to have been designed to replicate Google's legally successful book digitization approach—the same scanning operation that survived copyright challenges and established key fair use precedents. While destructive scanning is a common practice among some book digitizing operations, Anthropic's approach was somewhat unusual due to its documented massive scale. By contrast, the Google Books project largely used a patented non-destructive camera process to scan millions of books borrowed from libraries and later returned. For Anthropic, the faster speed and lower cost of the destructive process appears to have trumped any need for preserving the physical books themselves, hinting at the need for a cheap and easy solution in a highly competitive industry.

    "content": "Ubuntu users could see up to a 20 percent boost in graphics performance on Intel-based systems under a change that will turn off security mitigations for blunting a class of attacks known as Spectre. Spectre, you may recall, came to public notice in 2018. Spectre attacks are based on the observation that performance enhancements built into modern CPUs open a side channel that can leak secrets a CPU is processing. The performance enhancement, known as speculative execution , predicts future instructions a CPU might receive and then performs the corresponding tasks before they are even called. If the instructions never come, the CPU discards the work it performed. When the prediction is correct, the CPU has already completed the task. By using code that forces a CPU to execute carefully selected instructions, Spectre attacks can extract confidential data that the CPU would have accessed had it carried out the ghost instructions. Over the past seven years, researchers have uncovered multiple attack variants based on the architectural flaws, which are unfixable. CPU manufacturers have responded by creating patches in both micro code and binary code that restrict speculative execution operations in certain scenarios. These restrictions, of course, usually degrade CPU performance. Read full article Comments",

    "content": "Nearly a decade ago, Ars testing found that Valve's \"Steam Machines\"-era version of SteamOS performed significantly worse than Windows when SteamOS's Linux game ports were tested on the same hardware as their Windows counterparts. Today, though, Ars testing on the Lenovo Legion Go S finds recent games generally run at higher frame rates on SteamOS 3.7 than on Windows 11. The performance advantage is yet another way that Valve's upstart OS is differentiating itself from the \"default\" Windows installation used by most PC gamers for decades now. While users have been able to install Windows on the Steam Deck since its 2022 launch, Valve doesn't offer official \"Windows on Deck\" support for this alternative hardware use case. Lenovo's Legion Go S, on the other hand, is the first gaming portable explicitly designed to work with either Windows 11 (in hardware first released in January) or SteamOS (in hardware first released in May, alongside a new version of SteamOS designed for non-Valve AMD hardware). To test the performance impact of this operating system choice, we started with the SteamOS version of the Legion Go S (provided by Lenovo) and tested five high-end 3D games released in the last five years using built-in benchmarking tools and two different graphics/resolution tiers. We then installed Windows 11 on the handheld , downloaded updated drivers from Lenovo's support site , and re-ran the benchmarks on the same games downloaded through Steam for Windows.

Marvel Studios has been ramping up its marketing efforts for The Fantastic Four: First Steps in recent weeks, culminating with the release of one last trailer before the film premieres next month. While prior efforts have focused on the (very cool) 1950s/Tomorrowland kitschy vibe of the film, this newest trailer emphasizes the family angle is chock-full of lots of good old-fashioned superhero action, as the quartet takes on a world-devouring cosmic being. As previously reported , Marvel Comics' \"First Family\" hasn't been seen on the big screen since 2015's disastrous reboot of the moderately successful films from the 2000s. Per the film's official premise: Set against the vibrant backdrop of a 1960s-inspired, retro-futuristic world, The Fantastic Four: First Steps introduces Marvel’s First Family—Reed Richards/Mister Fantastic, Sue Storm/Invisible Woman, Johnny Storm/Human Torch, and Ben Grimm/The Thing as they face their most daunting challenge yet. Forced to balance their roles as heroes with the strength of their family bond, they must defend Earth from a ravenous space god called Galactus and his enigmatic Herald, Silver Surfer. And if Galactus’ plan to devour the entire planet and everyone on it weren’t bad enough, it suddenly gets very personal. Pedro Pascal plays Reed Richards/Mister Fantastic; Vanessa Kirby plays Sue Storm/Invisible Woman; Joseph Quinn plays Johnny Storm/Human Torch; Ebon Moss-Bachrach plays Ben Grimm/The Thing; and Matthew Wood voices their robot companion HERBIE. Ralph Ineson plays the gigantic cosmic being Galactus, and Julia Garner plays the Silver Surfer. The cast also includes Mark Gatiss as talk show host Ted Gilbert; Sarah Niles as Lynne; and Paul Walter Hauser, John Malkovich, and Natasha Lyonne in as-yet-undisclosed roles.

It was, at the time, the pinnacle of Mercedes engineering built for the purpose of maximum electric range . While an impressive piece of machinery that looked like it drove out of Le Mans, it wasn't designed to be a high-performance electric vehicle with an AMG badge. That's ok, though, because there is a high-performance AMG electric concept, called the GT XX, that introduces the world to the future of high-performance AMG electrics and debuts the AMG.EA architecture. The 800 V AMG.EA isn't like an 800-volt you've experienced before. Mercedes claims that the car can charge at greater than 850 kW over a wide portion of the charging session. While the company didn't provide any graphs, based on the hardware onboard, there's little reason to doubt that claim. To feed an EV that much power, the charging station would need to output at 1,000 A, and the company worked with its European partner Alpitronic to develop a prototype charging station. The current prototype uses a CCS connector, which is the standard in Europe. Read full article Comments",

Google's latest AI tool is for those terminal lovers. It's called Gemini CLI, and it shares a lot with Gemini Code Assist , but it works in your terminal environment instead of integrating with an IDE. And perhaps best of all, it's free and open source. Gemini CLI plugs into Gemini 2.5 Pro, Google's most advanced model for coding and simulated reasoning. It can create and modify code for you right inside the terminal, but you can also call on other Google models to generate images or videos without leaving the security of your terminal cocoon. It's essentially vibe coding from the command line. This tool is fully open source, so developers can inspect the code and help to improve it. The openness extends to how you configure the AI agent. It supports Model Context Protocol (MCP) and bundled extensions, allowing you to customize your terminal as you see fit.

Although the potential for axions to explain dark matter has been around for decades, cosmologists have only recently begun to seriously search for them. Not only might they be able to resolve some issues with older hypotheses about dark matter, but they also offer a dizzying array of promising avenues for finding them. But before digging into what the axion could be and why it’s so useful, we have to explore why the vast majority of physicists, astronomers, and cosmologists accept the evidence that dark matter exists and that it’s some new kind of particle. While it’s easy to dismiss the dark matter hypothesis as some sort of modern-day epicycle, the reality is much more complex (to be fair to epicycles, it was an excellent idea that fit the data extremely well for many centuries).

The observation was part of a combined global effort to determine the distance of the Earth from the Sun. Those observations proved less conclusive than had been hoped, but during the rest of the voyage, Cook was able to map the coastland of New Zealand before sailing west to the southeastern coast of Australia—the first record of Europeans on the continent's Eastern coastline.

    "summary": "From slow and steady to fast and snappy.",
    "content": "I've mostly been really happy with my M1 MacBook Air (2020) , which I've been using for nearly three years now. However, I regret not going for the variant with 16GB of RAM. The base M1 MacBook Air with 8GB RAM is a lot faster, cooler, and lasts longer than the Intel MacBook Air I used before it, but the newer laptop still occasionally slows down when I open too many browser tabs. Luckily, I did some troubleshooting and fixed the problem, and I'm here to share what I've learned with you. So, if Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari or other browsers are slowing down on your computer, try some of these tips to nip that problem in the bud. Identify what's causing the slowdown This is the hardest part of a browser slowdown, because quite often, there's no definitive answer to what the root problem is. It could be because you have an old and slow computer, or because you have too many open tabs that you never close, or because an extension is interfering with something, or a combination of multiple factors. To narrow down the list of possible issues, I recommend the golden rule of troubleshooting: deal with one thing at a time. This means that you should start by quitting all other apps, running just one browser with one tab, and then seeing if the slowdown is still present. If your browser works fine when you have one or two tabs open, and slows down once you open multiple tabs, that could point to an issue with the browser. If the browser works fine on its own, but slows down when you have other apps running, then the issue could be with a different app, or it could be a hardware limitation. If, after some troubleshooting, your browser really is the issue, then here's what you can do to fix it. Use your browser's task manager Credit: Pranay Parab Video streaming or web apps can lead to browser slowdowns, but the easiest way to confirm this is by using your browser's built-in task manager. Yes, your browser usually has a separate task manager, which lets you see which of its tabs are causing problems. In Firefox, accessing it as as simple as pressing Shift-Esc . Alternatively, you can click the three lines button in the top-right corner and go to More tools > Task Manager . You can even type about:processes in the address bar to do the same thing. In Chrome (and derivatives such as Edge and Brave), you'll need to press the three dots button in the top-right corner, then go to More Tools > Task Manager . Unfortunately, Safari doesn't have a built-in task manager, but you can open the Activity Monitor app on your Mac and type Safari in the search bar to view the process linked to each open tab and determine which one is causing a slowdown. Opening the browser's task manager is one thing, but it's also important to know what to look for once you have it open. Your browser's task manager shows you each tab's CPU and RAM usage, and you can use that information to determine the problem. If a tab's taking up too much of either, close the tab to see if it makes a difference. Usually, this does the trick. Close unused tabs That brings me to my next bit of advice: please, just close those tabs you opened five years ago. You're never going to get to them and you're not losing anything by closing them. This applies to me as much as it does to anyone else, so I'll be the first to admit my sins. I had a Persona 5 game guide open three years ago, when I played the game for 120-odd hours for the second time. I stopped playing the game before I reached the true ending (for a second time), but I still had the game guide tab open until a couple months ago. It wasn't doing anything or consuming too many resources, but when my browser slowed down, I had to let it go. I've accepted that I'll probably never finish the game, or read any of the various articles I have open in my other older tabs, or watch any of those videos I meant to get to. Closing all those inactive tabs helped speed up my browsers significantly. If you're still not ready to let go of your tabs, then you can also easily save all open tabs in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari . Delete unused extensions Credit: Pranay Parab I love using browser extensions to add useful features to my internet experience, but the extra steps they ask of your browser can sometimes cause slowdowns. This is especially true for extensions you no longer use, and deleting unused and potentially cumbersome extensions is good for performance (and your privacy, because extensions often require access to all your open pages). To quickly delete an old extension, open the about:addons page in Firefox, chrome://extensions page in Chrome and its derivatives, or click the Safari button in the menu bar and navigate to Settings > Extensions . I've also found some value in disabling extension only on specific webpages. As someone who suffers from migraines, I rely on Dark Reader to force every website to open in dark mode. Bright backgrounds trigger my headaches, which often end up ruining entire days, so I need to be careful with screen brightness and how webpages appear. However, Dark Reader was slowing down some tabs, and I found that disabling it for those specific webpages helped fix the problem. Restart the browser (and your computer) Sometimes, the solution to a slowdown is as simple a quick restart, which will give faulty processes a chance to correct themselves. You can try quitting the browser, restarting your computer, and launching the browser again to see if your issue is fixed. This is quite easy to do, but it's easy to forget the simplest and most obvious solutions, so I thought it was worth mentioning this here as well. Update your browser Credit: Pranay Parab The problem isn't always your computer, open tabs, or extensions. Sometimes, it may be a bug in the browser's code, which could cause a memory leak or use too much of your CPU's resources to run the app. There's nothing you can do to fix this, except ensure that your browser is updated to its newest version. Most browsers are usually quite good at updating themselves, but if you notice you're on an older version, you can update manually, too. I'll start with my go-to browsers. To update Firefox in Windows, click the three lines button in the top-right corner and select Help > About Firefox . On Mac, hit the Firefox button in the menu bar and select About Firefox . You can update Chrome (or its derivatives) by selecting the three dots button, then clicking Help > About Chrome . To update Safari on your Mac, you need to update macOS itself. Click the Apple logo in the top-left corner of the screen and go to System Settings > General > Software Update . Reduce ads and tracking Ads and trackers are increasing on almost every website, which tends to increase page loading times and can lead to browser slowdowns, too. You can counter this by using an adblocker such as uBlock Origin on Firefox and Chrome, and one of many good adblockers for Safari . You could also consider using a VPN with adblocking built-in or a good DNS service such as NextDNS . Any of these alternatives should reduce how often sites phone home, and how many trackers and other resource-heavy elements are loaded on webpages, which has a direct effect on your browser's performance (and security). Clear cookies and data Credit: Pranay Parab You could also see a performance improvement by clearing cookies and browser data. Be aware that doing so will require you to log in to your commonly visited websites the next time you visit them, and could also clear your browser's history. If you're okay with that, then you can try this as another option to speed up your browser. In Firefox, click the three lines button in the top-right corner and go to Settings > Privacy & Security . In the Cookies & Data section, select Clear Data… and confirm when asked. Next, go to the History section and click Clear History… . In Chrome, click the three-dots button in the top-right corner and go to Settings > Privacy and security > Delete browsing data .

Here, You can either select and remove individual websites' data, or select all and remove everything. Check the ambient temperature Ambient temperatures are rising across the world. Particularly in the summer, you could be using your computer in a hot room and experiencing slowdowns as a result. Modern computers have a thermal cutoff built-in, and if a device gets too hot, it will slow down at first, before shutting down entirely in order to protect your machine. This isn't going to slow down just your browser, though. Everything you do on your computer will run slower than usual if it's too hot where you are. You can try using a laptop cooler, an air conditioner, or other methods to cool down your computer. You'll see an immediate performance improvement once the computer is running at a lower temperature. Consider upgrading your computer Finally, if none of these solutions are working in the long run, then the problem may just be with the hardware you're using. Even cheap upgrades like replacing a hard drive with an SSD or adding more RAM could help, but in a lot of cases, you might want to get a brand new computer. I don't enjoy telling anyone to spend more money to solve problems, but sometimes that really is the only option. Buying my M1 MacBook Air was a solid decision in 2022, and at the time, even though my friends and family members chipped in to help, I couldn't afford the 16GB RAM variant. The next time I buy a computer, I'll ensure that it has a little more RAM than I need, so that browser slowdowns and other performance issues don't surface, at least for the first few years of the computer's life.",

    "summary": "Finally, a sensible snooze routine.",
    "content": "The iPhone’s Clock app is one of the slowest moving apps on iPhone. It gets less love and attention than even the Phone app. While there are many novel and interesting alarm apps out there , Apple’s default offering remains quite basic and un-customizable. With iOS 26, Apple is bringing customization to one much requested feature. You can now finally get out of snooze jail. Until now, the snooze duration for alarms was set to nine minutes, and you couldn't adjust it. It was either nine minutes or nothing. I, personally, like to snooze in five-minute increments. So, I got around this by setting six different alarms, all at five-minute intervals, to help me get up in the morning. But now, I can finally put this chaos aside. Snooze as you wish Credit: Khamosh Pathak In iOS 26, which is currently out in developer beta (and will soon be out as a public beta preview), you can now set the snooze duration to last anywhere between one minute (if you want to really annoy yourself), and 15 minutes (if time is merely a philosophical construct for you). Finally, I can set my snooze to that five minute sweet spot. Sadly, these changes are on a per-alarm basis, so you’ll have to customize your snooze every time you set a new alarm. Hopefully, though, I won’t have to set nearly as many alarms now as I did before. To customize your snooze duration in iOS 26, open the Clock app, go to the Alarms tab, and tap the Plus icon to create a new alarm. Or, you can tap on an alarm you already have. Then, tap the Snooze Duration option and choose any duration between one and 15 minutes. Tap the Done checkmark at the top to save the new alarm. The next time the alarm goes off, you’ll see a new alarm screen, with two equally big, beautiful buttons for snooze and stop. In previous versions of the app, you’d only see a snooze button in the middle, and a small Stop button below. And hey, if you’re a bit hardcore, like my colleague Pranay, you can also disable the Snooze button altogether .",

If you're looking to upgrade your everyday computer setup, this Surface Pro bundle on Amazon might actually be worth your attention. For $946.99 (the lowest price it’s hit so far, according to price trackers ), you get the latest 12-inch Surface Pro Copilot+ PC (2025 model) with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage—plus the Surface Pro Keyboard with Slim Pen 2 and a full year of Microsoft 365 Personal . Buying each piece on its own would run you nearly $1,150, so this bundle saves you over $200. More importantly, it saves you the hassle of piecing things together later when you realize your “deal” didn’t include a keyboard or the software you need to get anything done. Microsoft Surface Pro 12\" Copilot+ PC (2025), 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD | Keyboard + Slim Pen 2, Microsoft 365 Personal | 3-in-1 Bundle $946.99 at Amazon $1,149.97 Save $202.98 Get Deal Get Deal $946.99 at Amazon $1,149.97 Save $202.98 The Surface Pro itself is a versatile machine that works as a laptop when you need it and a tablet when you don’t. It’s powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X chip and runs Windows 11 with Microsoft’s Copilot+ features built in, which puts AI-assisted tools front and center for everyday use. If you're curious about where Microsoft is going with AI, this is the machine to try. The 12.3-inch PixelSense display is vibrant, and battery life holds up well for a day of remote work, meetings, or creative tasks. The included keyboard snaps on securely and makes typing feel comfortable, while the Slim Pen 2 works well for note-taking or sketching, and charges while docked in the keyboard, so it’s always ready. The bonus year of Microsoft 365 Personal adds even more value (you don’t need to budget separately for Office apps or cloud storage), especially if you’re already paying for Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or OneDrive separately. Between that and the improved Copilot features coming to Windows 11, this bundle is basically ready to go out of the box. It won’t be for everyone—if you need heavy-duty gaming or full-on video editing, you’ll want a different machine—but for students, hybrid workers, or anyone who likes the flexibility of a tablet/laptop combo , this is one of the most cost-effective Surface Pro bundles we’ve seen so far.",

    "link": "https://lifehacker.com/entertainment/top-generation-z-alpha-trends-of-2025?utm_medium=RSS",
    "summary": "Here’s what today’s youth are into instead of Friendster, flip phones, and flash mobs.",
    "content": "If you’re older than, let’s say, 28, there’s a decent chance you feel completely baffled by what younger people are doing off and online— I write about youth trends for a living , and I still don't really know; you can't fully know unless you're in it. The culture of 2025 is so fractured, ironic, algorithm-driven, and contradictory, it can feel alien, even fictional to outsiders. But on the other hand, we're all people, and the human spirit persists, even as it's being bent into impossible shapes by machines, greed, and carelessness. To help make some sense of it all—or at least give you a list of things to Google—here’s a snapshot of trends shaping Generations Z and A in the middle of 2025. AmIAlive Core Coined by writer Kyle Raymond Fitzpatrick , \" AmIAlive core \" isn't a well-known term among young people, but if there's a single concept that describes how Generations Z differs from previous generations, I thinks it's this. To simplify it: AmIAlive Core posits that young people don’t live life, they perform it, so they are subconsciously unsure if they are actually living human beings. Living entirely mediated lives in which \"experiences\" happen in video games and the outside world is seen through the vertical window of TikTok videos has made it impossible for young people to live authentically, so they play-act life and adopt styles and philosophies based on whether they think is compelling content. A vacation is a chance to pose for exotic Instagram pictures. A concert is a chance to whip out your phone instead of dancing. It's bleak, but that's where we are. The death (and continued life) of TikTok If there's a shared common space for Generations A and Z, it's the social media platform TikTok, and TikTok has been going through some things. In January 2024, the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act\" went into effect. It required that ByteDance (TikTok's parent company) either sell the app to a U.S. company or cease operations in the U.S. by January 19, 2025. In response, TikTok briefly went dark in the United States on the deadline date. For young people, the death of TikTok would be like losing a shared universe; a world would die. Some responded by flocking to other social media outlets like RedNote or lashing out in anger at the government. But luckily, nothing happened—yet. President Trump announced a 75-day hold to allow ByteDance to find a buyer. That was extended by 90 days on June 15 via executive order, leaving a platform in limbo: technically alive, but existentially shaky. AI everything The merciless cultural takeover that is artificial intelligence is affecting everyone, but no group will feel its impact more than Gen Z and Gen A. They are the first to grow up chatting with AI, learning from it, competing against it, and questioning it in real time. Whatever AI becomes, they’ll inherit it and help shape it. Artificial intelligence is already being used to cheat at school, spread religion , make jokes about Bigfoot, and create disturbing videos featuring kittens. Meanwhile, a growing contingent of young people are rejecting AI entirely, particularly when it comes to AI art. Prediction: Serious resistance against AI will grow among younger people. The 80/20 Rule and the gender wars Social and cultural conflict over gender roles is definitely not new, but Generations Z and A are adding a unique spin to the morass, most visibly with the 80/20 Rule. Put simply, the 80/20 rule is an axiom that states 80% of women are attracted to only 20% of men. The 80/20 Rule is discussed, memed, and repeated so often in online spaces for lonely dudes that's it's rarely questioned, even though it's pretty much total nonsense . Burning Chromebooks and other dangerous fads Young people have always been attracted to dumb, dangerous stunts, and there was a time when many of them were amplified by social media sites, particularly TikTok. These days, though, TikTok locks down fads like \"The Skull-Breaker Challenge\" with ruthless efficiency. But the trend of destroying school laptops slipped through the cracks for a couple of weeks as the school year ended . That these cheap laptops were the target of mindless teenage vandalism makes sense—they're an instantly recognizable symbol of educational conformity, circa 2025. Nostalgia for the early 2000s People are usually nostalgic for a more innocent age, but young people's fascination with the early 2000s seems to indicate the opposite. Through the lens of a teenager in 2025, the politically incorrect, crass, no-apologies pop culture of the early aughts represents a kind of lost freedom. \"Back then, you could do whatever you wanted without being canceled, arrested, or ridiculed,\" is the vibe. Obviously this isn't entirely true, but there's something to it. Most people didn't have smart phones back then, so it really was the last time kids could do stupid things and not be immediately posted on Instagram. 2000s nostalgia goes hand-in-hand with: The rise of neo-puritanism Kids may be yearning for wilder times, but they're mostly keeping their impulses in check. The trend of children being more behaviorally conservative than their parents and grandparents continued unabated in the first half of the year. Young people drink less , smoke less , do less drugs , and have less sex than previous generations. Whether these trends are due to a greater concern for personal well-being or the result of a locked-down culture and lack of freedom is up for debate, but the numbers speak for themselves. Millennial green and Millennial burger joints While there isn't much evidence of the kind of massive cultural generation gap that separated children and parents in the 1960s, that doesn't mean today's young people aren't turning a withering eye on the previous generation. Some may be trying to mimic the early 2000s, but others want to make sure older people know ridiculous they are, whether it's the millennial fascination with Harry Potter, the boring, beige and green decorating aesthetic that defined the era, or the faux-hipster folksiness of \" millennial burger joints .\" 100 men vs. a gorilla This meme is based on a simple but compelling question. Who would win in a fight to the death: 100 regular guys or a single gorilla? There are many theories , but no ethical way to answer the question. The meme sits at the intersection of absurdist humor, male insecurity, and simulation-brain thinking. I'm not sure why, exactly, but it feels revelatory about the younger generation in the same inexplicable way the popularity of \"pet rocks\" feels revelatory about Baby Boomers. The continuing rise of \"brain rot\" The above trends relate mostly to Generation Z. Generation A, people born between 2010 and 2024, are a different animal. That generation is defined by \"brain rot,\" an online style that is nearly impossible to understand. Brain rot describes online content with no educational, social, or artistic value. It also describes the effects that continued viewing of this content is suspected to have on its audience. Brain rot content often involves references to other memes, which are often themselves based on other memes. The eventual result is expressions that are impossible to understand for anyone but their intended audience. Here's how Cookie King , a pioneer of brain rot, described the inspiration for a video he posted: \"On Instagram, there was a new meme. It was about Chopped Chin and Property in Egypt, and people were doing battles between them. I was like, 'Wait, what if I just combined them together with the Johnnie Walker thing and the Friggin' Packet Yo?\" There has never been a better explanation presented.",

    "link": "https://lifehacker.com/health/peloton-bike-plus-auto-resistance?utm_medium=RSS",
    "summary": "Peloton's advanced at-home cycle, the Bike+, has a neat feature I liked more than I expected to.",
    "content": "We may earn a commission from links on this page. For two weeks, I've been testing out a Bike+, the upgraded version of Peloton's famous Bike, all so I can write reviews of it. Since I've been an avid rider of my regular Peloton Bike for four years, I've been paying attention to any differences I notice in the performance of the two stationary cycles—especially any differences that make their $1,000 price difference worthwhile. The feature I was most excited to test out, which my Bike does not have, is auto-resistance. With that, the Bike+ automatically adjusts the rider's resistance for them, setting it within the boundaries of the resistance called for by a instructor at any given point during a virtual class. How does the Bike+'s auto-resistance work? When you're taking an on-demand cycling class or completing a Power Zone workout , the Bike+ will adjust your resistance so that you're somewhere in between the numbers the instructor is calling for. So, if your instructor says your resistance should be between 40 and 60, the auto-resistance feature will plop you somewhere in the middle of those values; you don't have to spin the resistance knob yourself. The auto-resistance is pretty smart, in my experience. When I did a nighttime workout after a day full of teaching spin class, doing other Peloton rides, and walking around in the heat, I wasn't feeling particularly energetic or even athletic. The auto-resistance caught on to that and adjusted my resistance to the lower end of the spectrum the instructor was calling for. Overall, it just makes taking a class a little easier because you don't need to be constantly reaching down to adjust the knob. You can focus only on your cadence (and form, breathing, output, and hydration, of course) without having to stay on top of your resistance, too. How to enable (or disable) auto-resistance on the Bike+ Enabling and disabling auto-resistance can be done before or during a workout. When you select a workout to complete on your device's touchscreen, you'll see a pop-up window that outlines a few details like when the class first aired, who's teaching it, and what the class is called. You'll also see a button that says \"Auto-Resistance [Off/On],\" which will, obviously, signal to you that the feature is on or off before the class starts. Credit: Lindsey Ellefson Once the class begins, you'll see a small lock icon next to the resistance on the lower right half of the screen. You can tap it to unlock it (turn auto-resistance off) or lock it (turn it on). I've noticed that if I start a workout with it off, then toggle it on, the auto-resistance tends to stick near whatever I was doing on my own. For instance, this morning, I started a class with it off, but was only riding about five above the lowest recommended resistance. When the instructor said resistance should be between 30 and 45, I was only doing 35. (I'm teaching classes later tonight, so I didn't feel I needed to over-exert myself! Leave me alone!) When I toggled auto-resistance on by tapping the lock icon, it consistently kept me at about five over the lowest recommended resistance level. You can make manual adjustments while you ride, even if auto-resistance is turned on. At one point this morning, I did crank my resistance knob up to the highest recommended setting for a while. When the instructor told riders to lower their resistance a few minutes later, auto-resistance kicked in again and put me on a lower one with no issue, though it was, again, near the upper limits of the recommended range, since that's how I had set it manually. Is this feature worth an extra $1,000? The Peloton Bike+ is about $1,000 more than the regular Bike and will run you $2,495—with this auto-resistance feature being one of the main selling points. Peloton Bike+ $2,495.00 at Peloton Learn More Learn More $2,495.00 at Peloton I did appreciate that the tech is smarter that I assumed it would be and was able to adjust my resistance not only to the middle of the recommended resistance range, but lower or higher within it, depending on how I am performing. I also appreciate that it can be manually overridden mid-class and even disabled completely if you're not into it. It's great to be able to ride without having to constantly think about making adjustments, plus I find it a little motivating. When I'm in charge of the resistance (like I have been for four years riding my Bike), I can slack a little if I want to, you know? Who's going to stop me if I choose to set my resistance to the absolute lowest recommended number? With auto-resistance, I feel just a little guilt if I consider manually overriding it to make my workout easier. More often than not, of course, I find that having my resistance set to the middle or higher end of the recommended spectrum is completely doable; I'm lazy, not incapable. The auto-resistance helps me stop being quite so lazy, which is a little counterintuitive, since the machine is doing the work of messing with the knob for me. Still, If you don't mind reaching down and spinning that knob, if you don't think you'd find it particularly motivating to see your resistance set in the middle of the recommended range, or if you don't even think you'd use this feature, it may not be worth an extra grand. There are some other differences between the two bikes that could push you over the edge and make you want to spend that extra dough, but don't forget that the membership that allows you to take the classes will cost you $44 per month forever, even after you've paid off the Bike, so that's another expense to consider. Overall, I genuinely like this feature, but when I've disabled it or gone back to my trusty Bike after using it, I haven't really missed it. It's unique, cool, and useful, but it's not necessary . Coupled with the other improvements in the Bike+, however, it makes a strong case for an upgrade: The Bike+ has better speakers, a bigger screen, simpler adjustment knobs to change seat and screen height, and overall better performance while running Peloton's proprietary software. All of that combined with the extraordinarily efficient auto-resistance makes for a better machine. If you're looking to upgrade from your existing Bike to a Bike+, consider selling your older model on Peloton's own resale site , which will get you some cash plus a few hundred off your Bike+ purchase.",

People who pre-register and end up buying one of the phones will get a $50 credit , which you can use on accessories like cases or screen protectors on Samsung.com or in the Shop Samsung App . Samsung is also offering up to $1,150 in trade-in credits when you turn in a qualifying device through the Samsung Trade-In Program. You'll be able to then use that credit towards your purchase of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 or Z Flip 7. Both of these deals are temporary, with no details on when they will end. Keep in mind that by putting your name down right now, you're not committing yourself to buying the phones; you're just placing a reservation to pre-order the phones later, so you can always back out. If you're sure you'll be buying one of these phones, it's better to put your name down rather than wait for the release.

The company is cutting off most support for the older operating system on October 14, 2025, pushing users toward Windows 11.

You can either opt into Windows Backup to sync your settings to the cloud or redeem 1,000 Microsoft Rewards points, which are accrued when you purchase or otherwise engage with Microsoft services, including Bing. Note that both of these \"free\" alternatives require you to have (or sign up for) a Microsoft account. If you're still on Windows 10, you'll receive a push notification about the program, or you can find the enrollment wizard in your Settings app. Enrollment is already open in the Windows Insider Program, and Microsoft plans to roll it out for Windows 10 customers in July, with availability to all by mid-August.

    "content": "We may earn a commission from links on this page. The days are long and the weather gives you a sense of what the inside of an air fryer must feel like. While June is full of hope, July is just sweaty—and we’re closing in. The good news is that plants love the long sunny hours and gnarly humidity. Summer’s produce will directly benefit as it ripens during this time—and so will you. This monthly article can help you decide which fruits and veggies to buy before they skyrocket in price, or completely disappear for another 10 months. Why seasonal and local produce beats off-season Local produce is naturally going to be in season. Not only does buying local produce support regional farms situated somewhere closer to where you live but you’re likely to benefit from a cheaper price tag. When all of the sweet corn gets harvested, and all of those New Jersey blueberries get picked, they won’t last forever. Not just at the farmer’s market either; big box stores like ShopRite will also have a glut of zucchini that they’ll mark down significantly. You’ll probably see a greater variety of tender greens and delicate fruits that don’t travel out of state well too. And let’s not forget about flavor: In-season produce is robust . If you’ve ever had an imported, wintertime tomato and then tasted an in-season tomato from a local garden (maybe even your own), you know they almost taste like different fruits entirely. What’s in season right now My very favorite fruits are beginning to stroll into the grocery store: peaches. These along with other incredible stone fruits are what I wait for all year. Don’t just buy enough fruit; buy “too much.” The excess is great for smoothies (here are a couple great blenders that might interest you), and pies. The new produce ready for harvest in for July: Apples Blueberries Raspberries Peaches Plums Nectarines Tart cherries Collard greens Snap beans (green beans) Carrots Cucumbers Onions Peppers Potatoes Tomatoes Get ‘em before they’re gone: Sweet Cherries Garlic scapes Green sweet peas Rhubarb Snap peas Snow peas Produce in peak season: Beet greens Apricots Strawberries Beets Broccoli Cabbage Garlic Mustard greens Zucchini & summer squash Lettuce Radishes and their greens Spinach Swiss chard Keep in mind that availability varies by a few weeks regionally—so don’t be jealous if rhubarb left you a week ago, and don’t get cocky if you started seeing plums at the farmer’s market already. Do consider getting a chest freezer though, because you’ll want to freeze your peak season fruits in a month or so. (Here’s the best way to freeze fruit .) Midea MERC04C4BAWW 3.5 Cubic Feet Chest Freezer, Cu.ft-Convertible, White $199.99 at Amazon Shop Now Shop Now $199.99 at Amazon What to cook with your bounty Fruits July is about the time we all start to hate turning on our ovens. It’s OK to avoid pie baking if need be. Instead, use your summer fruit bounty in no-bake desserts and for goodness’ sake, eat the stuff raw. Add peaches and plums to your cereal, oatmeal, or yogurt. Make stovetop compotes, which are quick and easy. Or you can really avoid the heat and use the microwave. I use frozen berries in this microwave compote but you can use fresh fruit too. Don’t count out the air fryer either. Roasting fruits, vegetables, and cooking small pies is quicker and the heat is less radiant than with the conventional oven. Here are my favorite air fryers of 2025 so far. Naturally, the best way to cool off is with a frozen treat. Mix fresh fruit or your newly made microwave compote into homemade ice cream, sorbet, or a slushy. I suggest a simple ice cream maker like this Cuisinart Pure Indulgence , or for a single serving, nothing beats the Dash My Mug . If you really want to get fancy, use the Ninja Slushi for a frozen drink. Blend your fresh fruit into a puree before adding it into your drink mixture. Speaking of refreshing drinks, you can also use frozen fruit to function as ice cubes for your summer cocktails. You can even use them to make an infused shaken Campari cocktail . If you can get used to a little oven warmth, now’s the time to churn out some pies. Cherry pies, peach pies, or blueberry tarts—whatever fruit you can get your hands on. Here’s my fail-proof way to lattice pie crust , and my best advice on preventing soggy fruit pies . If you’ve had trouble with pie in the past, give these a read. Vegetables Beans, carrots, cucumbers, peppers, and tomatoes are all joining us for July. Sounds like a salad to me. If you’re not a fan of raw salad (I understand), try a warm salad with some grains tossed in. Make a quick stir fry with the cabbage, peas, and greens. Now is also the best time to make a crudité platter . I know, it sounds boring, but raw produce never tastes better than when it’s in peak season. This goes for both fruits and veg: grill them. It almost couldn't be easier. Swipe a neutral cooking oil over planks of squash or halved peaches and pop them on the blisteringly hot grates for a minute just to get some color. Salt them when they come off the heat. Before you know it, we’ll all be swimming in tomatoes . And during that time, we have a duty to eat as many as possible every day. Get a jar of mayo and sliced bread ready for when that time finally swings around.",

    "link": "https://lifehacker.com/the-pros-and-cons-of-apple-pay-later?utm_medium=RSS",
    "summary": "Apple discontinued their \"buy now, pay later\" program, but third party plans still work with Apple Pay.",
    "content": "As you're checking out your Prime Day deals in just a few weeks, one payment option you'll want to reconsider is \" buy now, pay later \" financing. Last year Apple discontinued its own take on “buy now, pay later” (BNPL), Apple Pay Later . The service may no longer be available in name, but BNPL purchases are readily available when you check out with Apple Pay. So, what exactly has changed about paying with installments via Apple Pay, and what sets it apart from other BNPL programs—for better or for worse? What is “buy now, pay later?” A “buy now, pay later” service is exactly what it sounds like: You can make a purchase immediately, and then pay for it through a series of installments over time. Although BNPL has some perks for breaking up a major expense, there are risks involved. Even if these loans have little-to-no interest, you are still taking on debt. And while BNPL plans don’t directly impact users’ credit scores at the moment, that's set to change. Coming this fall, FICO says it will start including BNPL payment histories in how it calculates credit scores. If you're at risk of not getting your BNPL payments in according to schedule, you'll be putting your credit score at risk, too. Any personal finance writer with a semblance of a conscience will advise against making a habit of using these services. They’re helpful if you really need to finance something big, but whenever possible, it’s best to avoid taking on debt for everyday expenses. How can you pay with installments using Apple Pay? The official \"Apple Pay Later\" is no more, but Apple Pay is still an omnipotent digital wallet with BNPL options. Major BNPL providers like Affirm, Afterpay, and Klarna have partnered with Apple to offer their services directly through Apple Pay. How to set up BNPL with Apple Pay The setup process varies slightly depending on your BNPL provider: For Klarna: Download the Klarna app and create an account. Complete the verification process. In the Klarna app, look for the option to add to Apple Wallet. Follow the prompts to add your Klarna card to Apple Pay. For Affirm: Create an Affirm account through their app or website. Get pre-qualified for spending limits, up to $30,000. Add the Affirm virtual card to your Apple Wallet. Use it like any other payment method in Apple Pay. For Afterpay: Download the Afterpay app and set up your account. Link a debit or credit card for your installment payments. Afterpay should pop up directly at checkout when using Apple Pay. When you make a purchase using BNPL through Apple Pay, the total amount is automatically divided into your installment plan. Your first installment is typically charged immediately, while the BNPL company pays the merchant the full amount. All your subsequent installments are automatically charged to your linked payment method according to schedule. What are the risks of these BNPL programs? Naturally, Apple users may be drawn to the convenience of a BNPL options during Apple Pay checkout. However, that convenience might just be the biggest risk. They can make it all too easy to spend more than you can actually afford. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau released a report that shows BNPL users were more likely to have higher credit card debt, delinquencies on other credit products, and lower credit scores than nonusers. The bottom line If you are going to use any BNPL service, keep these tips in mind: Think about your current and future budget. When a bigger payment gets broken down into smaller installments, you might find yourself overspending in the long run because it \"feels\" like you can afford it. Stay on top of how much you’re actually spending, and how it will impact your overall budget going forward. Stick to the essentials. BNPL should really only be used on completely necessary purchases that you can’t afford upfront, but can afford in six weeks. Keep an eye on your account balance. Klarna, Affirm, or an BNPL service are not credit cards. Even if Apple doesn’t charge fees for missed payments, your bank will still charge you overdraft fees. Plus, if you default on a BNPL loan, you’re at risk of damaging your credit score. The most important thing is that you know what you're doing: Before you pay for anything with installments, be thoughtful about why you’re taking on this debt in the first place.",

    "summary": "Can I please stop carrying my driver's license everywhere I go?",
    "content": "Why do I still carry a wallet ? My iPhone can handle just about anything you used to need a traditional wallet for. Most (if not all) of my purchases are made via Apple Pay or QR code, my phone holds all of my pictures, and most of my receipts go straight to my email. Basically the only I keep my wallet around is to carry my ID. Once my state starts supporting Apple’s digital ID feature, however, things will change between me and my wallet—provided that support ever comes. Since iOS 15.4 , Apple has allowed you to add a driver’s license or other state ID to your iPhone’s digital wallet. That doesn’t mean you’ve been needlessly carrying your ID around since then—states have been slow to roll out their own support the feature, and most have yet to sign on at all. When I first covered this feature in 2022, only two states actively allowed you to add your ID to your iPhone , while 10 more (plus Puerto Rico) had confirmed plans to offer the option eventually, on a loose timeline of “soon.” Fast forward three years, and just 9 states and one territory now officially allow you to add IDs to Wallet. These states support digital ID now Here’s the full list as it stands in June 2025: Arizona California Colorado Georgia Hawaii Iowa Maryland New Mexico Ohio Puerto Rico Support is still \"coming soon\" in these states These states had originally pledged that support was \"coming soon,\" but after nearly three years, still haven't committed: Connecticut Kentucky Mississippi Oklahoma Utah Airports where you can use a digital ID in Apple Wallet Now, be warned: You can't simply hand a cop your iPhone when you get pulled over. There are specific, limited use cases for this feature. Right now, that means identifying yourself at the airport, as well as at select businesses. Apple worked with the TSA to make this happen, and it currently works at the following airports: Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI) Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Airport (CVG) Daniel K. Inouye International Airport (HNL) Denver International Airport (DEN) Des Moines International Airport (DSM) Eastern Iowa Airport (CID) Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL) John Glenn Columbus International Airport (CMH) Los Angeles International (LAX) Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport (SJU) Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (PHX) San Francisco International Airport (SFO) San Jose Mineta International (SJC) This feature will also work with participating businesses to verify your age. That includes bars, restaurants, liquor stores, festivals, concerts, and certain age-restricted apps. That business will need to have age verification set up on their end, but if so, Apple says you can tap your iPhone against theirs to pull up your ID. Then, you can double-click your iPhone's side button to confirm you'd like to share your ID. How to add a digital ID to your iPhone If you do live in a supported state, setting up the feature is simple. Open Wallet, then, tap the (+) in the top right, then choose “Driver’s License and ID Cards.” Choose your state, then choose whether to add the ID to your iPhone 8 or newer, as well as your Apple Watch Series 4 or newer. Either way, you’ll need to scan your ID with your iPhone’s camera, then scan your face to prove your identity. Once complete, send all information to your state to confirm. Credit: Lifehacker The next time you fly from a participating airport, you can unlock your iPhone and place it next to the ID scanner. You’ll see your digital ID appear, complete with all information you will be sharing with the TSA if you approve (name, date of birth, sex, ID number, state, issue and expiration dates, real ID status, and ID photo).",

    "link": "https://lifehacker.com/money/how-to-fix-inaccurate-attempted-delivery-messages-when-home?utm_medium=RSS",
    "summary": "Delivery services sometimes seem hell bent on not delivering your package despite your best efforts.",
    "content": "The scenario is always the same: You're waiting anxiously for an important package , which UPS or FedEx confidently tells you will arrive by “end of day.” You wait all day, watching for the package, only to discover that the delivery driver claims they tried to deliver the package, but no one was home. Why you're getting \"delivery attempted\" notices The logistics behind getting your Amazon package from a fulfillment center halfway around the country (or the world) to your door are incredibly complex, so it’s not terribly surprising that there will be occasional hiccups. The “attempted delivery” sticker serves a vital function: It lets you know that your package is being handled, and gives a warning that you’ll need to be home to receive it. Usually, you get a few delivery attempts before the package is returned to the shipper. While it’s rare that a driver would lie about trying to deliver your package, it’s not impossible. Drivers have heavy schedules to adhere to, and falling behind usually isn’t acceptable. Drivers typically have a bit of discretion when it comes to attempting deliveries—they can refuse to enter unsafe areas or properties, for example. And not all drivers care about the reputation of the parent company; while most drivers working for United Parcel Service (UPS) work directly for them, most of the drivers working for Fed Ex Ground are actually third-party hires , which means they might be more motivated to keep up with their route schedule and get home than ensuring everyone gets their package as quickly as possible. One of the most maddening things about missed “attempted delivery” notices is that you’ll often get a photo of your house as proof that the driver was physically there. This is often necessary for the driver, as their location is tracked, so they can’t simply claim to have been there. But as his person notes in their video , these photos are often taken from the truck as it drives by , allowing the driver to save a minute or two while documenting a delivery “attempt.” What to do if you keep getting \"delivery attempted\" notices There’s no magic bullet for ensuring your package shows up as promised. But there are some steps you should take that can help: Sign up for alerts . UPS, FedEx, and other shippers let you sign up for delivery updates via text, email, or app. This way, you’ll get a notice that a delivery was attempted just a few seconds after the driver scans the package. That might enable you to rush outside to catch a driver who’s simply confused, but it also means you can take action immediately. Complain. Contact the delivery company and lodge a complaint. Make sure you have all the details, like the tracking number and the date and time of the attempted delivery. Creating a record with customer service is an essential, if frustrating, step. Being able to do this immediately after the attempted delivery notice helps buttress your case, since you’re clearly home, waiting for the package. Capture footage. Some consumers have reported that submitting video that shows drivers going past their house at the time a delivery attempt was supposedly made has resulted in refunds and expedited delivery responses. Re-route. If your main priority is to get your hands on your package, you can usually contact the shipping company and have them re-route the package to a pickup location near you. This isn’t as convenient as having it dropped at your door, but usually ensures you actually get it. Some frustrated folks have suggested that contacting customer service immediately after receiving an attempted delivery notice and claiming that the package is an urgent one can help, as these sorts of claims will usually be escalated to a supervisor automatically. That seems ethically sketchy, but might be effective if you’re desperate.",

    "link": "https://lifehacker.com/tech/new-features-and-changes-in-the-latest-macos-tahoe-beta?utm_medium=RSS",
    "summary": "Plus, Apple has \"fixed\" the Finder icon.",
    "content": "I'm pretty excited about macOS Tahoe. Apple's annual operating system upgrade is poised to introduce a number of exciting new features and changes , including a fresh design and an upgraded Spotlight Search . Tahoe won't be available to the general public for a while, as the OS is still in beta testing as Apple irons out the kinks. To that end, the company dropped the second beta for macOS Tahoe this week, and it includes three key features I'm particularly interested in. AirPods beta enrollment Speaking of beta testing, did you know that Apple has a beta program for AirPods? If you didn't, that's probably by design, since up until now, only developers could enroll their AirPods in the beta. That's now changing: With Apple's latest releases this fall, users will be able to opt-in to the AirPods beta firmware updates, too. If you want to test out new features on your AirPods, at the risk of glitches or bugs, you can. On macOS Tahoe beta 2, that option is present in the settings for your AirPods. If you open System Settings > Bluetooth , then choose the (i) . Here, you'll see \"AirPods Beta Updates,\" which contains the opt-in toggle. Once you enroll your AirPods, they'll install beta updates when in their charging case and within range of your Mac. The Finder icon has been \"fixed\" Apple's new \"Liquid Glass\" design has been met with both praise and criticism. But ignoring the love/hate glassy effect itself, one change, at least on macOS, was particularly controversial: the Finder icon. While Apple's Finder icon has gone through numerous design changes over the years, the overall concept has remained largely the same: The left side of Finder's face is dark blue, while the right side is lighter. Apple literally flipped the script with the first beta of macOS Tahoe, by making the entire logo light, and the right side dark blue. What's more, the right side was reduced, so you could see the light background behind it. It's was a big change, design-wise, and many were unhappy about it. Luckily, macOS Tahoe is in beta, which means anything can change before the final release. The Finder icon is one such case: With beta 2, Apple has restored Finder logo's original color scheme. As you can see below, the left side of the face, as well as the background as a whole, are dark blue, while the right side is back to light: This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed. Classic Finder fans will likely prefer this change, though Apple is still sticking with the smaller right face. While that may still be controversial to some, I think it fits the new Liquid Glass theme while retaining the icon's original appeal. Truthfully, I don't actually hate the original attempt from the first beta, and I wouldn't be opposed to Apple offering multiple versions of its icons in future releases that you can change up depending on your personal style. That said, if I had to choose one design right now, I'm going with this one from beta 2. You can bring back the menu bar's background Another big design change for macOS Tahoe is the transparent menu bar. It's the first time Apple's menu bar icons will just float on top of your desktop, without a defined bar in place. It's a cool look, but as of beta 2, you don't need to live with it. Apple has added a new \"Show menu bar background\" option in Settings, that brings back the menu bar's classic look. If you don't like the transparent look, or you find it difficult to differentiate between the menu bar and you desktop, this might be a good setting to change: This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.",

    "link": "https://lifehacker.com/biggest-tech-discounted-brand-prime-day?utm_medium=RSS",
    "summary": "There will be plenty of Prime Day deals, but these will be the most dramatic.",
    "content": "We may earn a commission from links on this page. Prime Day 2025 is coming up , and with it comes a surge of discounts and savings. While Amazon wants you to think each and every deal you come across is worth your time and attention, the truth is few of these deals are actually that great . All the chaos overwhelms even the most seasoned online shopper, making it hard to know if you’re really saving money at all . But there’s one category that will undoubtedly stand out on Prime Days by design: tech made by Amazon itself . That means items like Fire tablets, Fire TV Cubes, and anything else specifically made by Amazon. For typical tech sales, most retailers want you buying whatever they can convince you to plunk down money for, be it an iPhone or an Android, a Mac or PC, Xbox or PlayStation. They just want as much of your money as possible, and so traditional shopping events like Black Friday see deals across the spectrum of brands and manufacturers. But Amazon is different. Amazon is both a store and a manufacturer While the company sells tons of products from a wide variety of manufacturers, it also makes its own tech. If you’re looking for a new smart TV, Amazon makes one ; if you just want the smart TV streaming device, Amazon makes that as well . For home security, there are both Blink and Ring products . Alexa powers so many of these devices, so why not get one of its smart speakers or screens operated via the personal assistant? Amazon Basics even makes plenty of accessories, from USB cables to batteries. Amazon now makes so much tech, it only makes sense that the company would prefer to sell you its version of a product over that of the competition. Instead of a Roku, buy a Fire TV stick. Instead of a Nest Mini, buy an Echo Pop. It seems Amazon has comparable products in almost every category—they even make their own earbuds ( Echo Buds ). The quality of these products compared to the competition is certainly up for debate, and I encourage you to do your own research before buying any tech product—made by Amazon or otherwise. But whenever you do search for a tech product on Amazon, and especially during Prime Day, you’re going to be served up an Amazon alternative. It’s only in the company’s best interest to use the event to run big deals on its own products. Amazon is still a market, and it’s good for them when you buy anything, so if you end up going with a Samsung TV over an Amazon TV, that’s still a sale. That's why you’ll still find plenty of deals throughout Prime Day for non-Amazon devices. But Amazon products will be pushed the hardest and likely see the biggest discounts and promotions. Still, don’t impulse buy Eye-grabbing discounts and tempting product bundles aside, don’t buy an Amazon device just because it looks like a killer deal. If you are in the market for a specific Amazon-made product and it goes on sale, great. That’s a smart purchase. If you were more interested in a non-Amazon device but the Amazon version is now significantly cheaper, though, it’s not necessarily worth chasing value over getting the product you actually want to buy. Take the time to research the difference between Amazon’s version and the competition. If you do find an Amazon device you want to buy, you can set alerts to be notified when the product hits the price you're looking for . That’s good general advice for any Prime Day deal (or any big-ticket purchase), but considering how hard Amazon will be pushing its own products in July, it’s especially important to keep in mind. If you buy anything on Prime Day, I hope you get deals on the best devices for you , whether Amazon made them or not.",

    "content": "Netflix's July lineup includes Happy Gilmore 2 (July 25), a much-anticipated sequel with Adam Sandler and Christopher McDonald reprising their roles as Happy and Shooter McGavin, respectively. The film, set 30 years after the original, sees Happy Gilmore's return to golf to pay for his daughter's ballet school. The list of cameos by pro golfers and other stars in sports and music is long. Less comedy, more drama is Untamed (July 17), a limited mystery thriller series featuring Eric Bana as a special agent for the National Parks Service as he hunts for a killer in Yosemite National Park. Sam Neill also stars. Netflix has a long list of documentaries premiering in July, including Apocalypse in the Tropics (July 14), which explores the role of evangelical Christianity on far-right politics in Brasil, including the rise of president Jair Bolsonaro. The film premiered at the Venice International Film Festival in August 2024 and was directed by Petra Costa, who also created the highly acclaimed The Edge of Democracy . July also brings two new reality series: All The Sharks (July 4), is a six-episode competition in which four teams race to photograph the most sharks and shark habitats, while Building The Band (July 9) brings 50 singers together to form musical groups without ever seeing each other. Netflix is also dropping five installments of Trainwreck , its anthology docu-series covering major news events gone wrong. This month's stories include the rise and fall of fashion brand American Apparel ( The Cult of American Apparel , July 1), the viral 2008 Project X party ( The Real Project X , July 8), the 2009 balloon boy hoax ( Balloon Boy , July 15), the P.I. moms scandal ( P.I. Moms , July 22), and the viral storming of Nevada's Area 51 ( Storm Area 51 , July 29). On the sports side, docu-series Tour de France: Unchained (July 2) and Quarterback (July 8) return, alongside the new WWE: Unreal (July 29)—WWE Raw and other WWE content is now exclusive to Netflix. The platform will also host a live boxing match between Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano on July 11, streaming from Madison Square Garden.

    "title": "Eight Issues to Negotiate With Your New Neighbors As Soon As You Move In",
    "link": "https://lifehacker.com/home/what-to-negotiate-with-new-neighbors?utm_medium=RSS",
    "summary": "Come to an understanding on these crucial issues right away.",
    "content": "Most of us get along just fine with our neighbors—sometimes we even become friends. But even if you’re friendly with the people on your block, in your cul de sac, or across the hall, you can still run into disputes with them, and those disputes can turn ugly. That’s why it’s a good idea to do some negotiating the moment you move into your new place. By addressing potential issues right away, you can avoid any future awkwardness. Parking Iif you’re like most people in this country, you rely on your vehicle to get to and from work, to buy groceries—to do almost anything outside of your immediate area. If you’re going to be relying on street parking, the time to address that need is immediately. Find out how much parking is generally available, and how people approach disputes over sloppy parking that eliminates valuable spaces, \"saving\" spots with chairs or other items, and those neighbors who seem to think the spot in front of their house is somehow theirs by right. Once you know the traditions and the existing treaties that neighbors have negotiated around parking, you can broach any special needs you might have, like a large truck that’s going to eat up extra space, or a family member who needs easy access to the vehicle due to mobility issues. If your new home comes with a driveway , you might think you’re in the clear—until a neighbor parks in your driveway because they assume you only need to access it at certain times, or just because it suits them. Bringing up the subject and noting that you need the driveway clear at all times can prevent that moment when you want to drive somewhere but first have to hunt down a neighbor to get their car moved. Sleep schedules Not everyone sleeps on the same—or even compatible—schedules. If you work night shifts, or have a routine that includes very early mornings or very late nights, it’s a good idea to let your neighbors know as soon as possible. A little warning that—despite your best efforts—you might make some noise in the wee hours when you go to work, or that you sleep during the day and would appreciate some peace and quiet, can lead to a healthy conversation and an arrangement that avoids future arguments. Fencing and trespassing Whether it’s the maintenance of a shared fence , a garden that creeps over the official property line, or tree branches that overhang your roof, it’s a good idea to note potential boundary issues as soon as you move in. If nothing else, you’ll know right away whether your neighbor is going to be reasonable about these issues or if you need to prepare for battle. And if you plan to have any work done to the property that might require an easement or access to your neighbor’s property—even if you don’t plan to start work for a long time—negotiating that access as a general principle can save you trouble when the time comes. Another boundary issue that’s worth raising: trespassing. The word sounds dire, but any time someone traverses your property without explicit permission, it’s trespassing. That includes the neighbor who finds it easier to cut through your yard than to go around, the neighbor’s kids who use your yard as an extension of theirs, or the \"helpful\" guy who mows your lawn the way he likes it. It’s your property, and you have every right to allow folks to use it—or not. And the same goes for your neighbor. Having a conversation about what you’re both comfortable with is a great way to keep the peace for as long as you live there. Pets Pets bring a lot of joy to people’s lives, but they can be terrible neighbors—they live their lives blissfully ignorant of property law and the rules of polite society. So if you’re bringing a pet into the neighborhood or moving into a spot heavily populated by animal companions, negotiating what’s okay and what’s not okay is a must. This can also include letting your neighbors know important things about your pets. For example, if you have an inside-only cat, you can ask your neighbor to always let you know if they see it outdoors. Or if your dog has anxiety around strangers, you can warn them not to let their kids get too close. Shared walls If you share walls with your neighbors, you might want to go beyond a casual negotiation on moving day and suggest a more formal party wall agreement . Shared walls can be problematic—damage affects both parties, maintenance should be shared, and what you do on your side of the wall will almost certainly be audible on the other side. Outdoor lights Outdoor lights in a yard or on a balcony or deck can be delightful—unless it’s three in the morning and the lights are aimed directly into your bedroom window. Neighbors don’t always think about the fact that outdoor lights are often left on all the time, especially now that so many are solar-powered. Asking your neighbors about the placement and operation of your outdoor lights offers the chance to then politely request that your neighbors put their lights on a timer, or orient them so they’re not aimed directly at your house. Security cameras Security cameras can help you feel safe in your new home—but the best time to negotiate privacy issues with your neighbors is right away. You don’t want to break any laws when setting up your cameras, of course, and you also have no interest in making your neighbors feel like they’re being watched. But not everyone thinks carefully about how they arrange security cameras, so it’s worth checking out how your neighbors have handled this so you can politely ask for adjustments. Working together to negotiate what is and isn’t on camera will enhance your security—because you’ll have built trust and shared interests with your neighbors—and avoid awkward moments. Renovations If you bought your new place with the intention of doing a gut renovation, you know you’ll be the most hated person in your neighborhood pretty much the moment the chaos begins . Anticipating and negotiating aspects of the renovation is a very good idea. If your neighbors understand the scope of the project, they’ll be much less likely to complain and throw up roadblocks. Some aspects of a renovation that you should discuss ahead of time include: Contractor parking needs (especially if they’re going to be eating up multiple spaces, or blocking roads and driveways) Noise and schedules—your neighbors may have important events coming up, like work meetings or interviews, that would benefit from a break in the endless hammering and sawing Property access, especially if there are areas of your property that can only be accessed via a neighbor’s property You should also ask your neighbors if they have specific concerns. For example, if you’re going to be tearing up your yard, a neighbor might worry about their trees or plantings being affected. Negotiating how you’ll safeguard those areas ahead of time will make everything go a lot more smoothly.",

    "link": "https://lifehacker.com/tech/best-android-16-features-that-havent-yet-launched?utm_medium=RSS",
    "summary": "This sure is a slow rollout.",
    "content": "Earlier this month, Google announced the launch of Android 16 , available first on Pixel devices. If you've got a Pixel 6 or a Pixel 6 Pro (launched in 2021) or a later device, you should already have the software update. What you won't have, however, are many of the new features that Google has been promoting with this Android upgrade—an upgrade that feels like a placeholder for what's coming later in the year. If you're rebooting your phone after installing Android 16 and looking around to see what's new, you might be disappointed. There are a couple of bits of relevant context: First, Android 16 was launched much earlier in the year (June) than Android 15 (October), most probably to get well ahead of the Google Pixel 10 launch. It looks as though most of the major Android 16 updates will arrive around September or October. Second, these major Android releases are, now more than ever, mainly for Pixel phones. Every Android phone maker puts its own spin on the Android code Google provides, and may not support every feature—or add extra features Google hasn't got around to. Samsung's One UI 8 , based on Android 16, is the best example. Further adding to the confusion are the additional Pixel Drops that Google regularly pushes out for its own phones and tablets. The most recent one arrived at the same time as Android 16, and brought with it features such as Pixel VIPs , for giving selected contacts a higher priority on your device. So, while Android 16 doesn't bring much that's new to my Pixel phone right now, there's plenty still on the way: Here are four key upgrades I'm looking forward to. Material 3 Expressive Material 3 Expressive is quite a departure in terms of visuals. Credit: Google Google has already told us about the big design revamp that's coming to Android 16, throwing around phrases like \"emotional impact\" and \"more engaging\" and \"makes you feel something\"—which in reality means more color, more curves, and screens that don't look quite as spartan as they do in Android 15. From the screenshots Google has shared, it looks good, but I haven't even seen it appear in Google's own apps or the Android settings menus yet (that's due in September, as per an Android Authority source). After that, third-party developers will push their own updates out, so it's going to take a while for everything to be Material 3 Expressive-ized. Live Updates How Live Updates will work, eventually. Credit: Google Android can already show real time information like timers and Uber estimates in persistent notifications, but Live Updates on Android 16 will make these notifications much more prominent, detailed, and interactive—a lot like Live Activities on iOS . Samsung is already ahead on this, with the Now Bar available in One UI 7. However, I haven't seen a single app take advantage of Live Updates so far. It seems Android 16 is only laying the groundwork for the feature, and it's now over to app developers to get it implemented—something I expect will happen gradually over the coming months. A full desktop mode The new desktop mode is live now for tablets. Credit: Google Android 16 is much more capable on bigger screens, with better management of window resizing and grouping, so it's more desktop-like. This is an upgrade that is actually live now, but only for Android tablets—you're not going to be able to use it yet on an external monitor connected to your Pixel phone. We know from the Android 16 betas and Google I/O 2025 that the phone functionality support is on the way—so you'll be able to use your phone in desktop mode when connected to a monitor—but it's not here yet. This is another area where Samsung is already ahead, with its Samsung DeX tool . Notification stacking How notification groups are going to look. Credit: Google The final announced-but-not-yet-live Android 16 feature is notification stacking, or \"forced notification auto-grouping,\" as it's officially described . \"Your notifications will automatically be grouped together to keep things looking tight and organized,\" says Google in the Android 16 announcement blog post . Here, too, I'm still waiting. Android actually already does a decent job of grouping together notifications from the same app, so I'm not exactly sure what's going to be different, but based from the limited number of screenshots that have been shared, it looks as though the grouping will be more compact and easier to manage.",

    "link": "https://lifehacker.com/tech/2025-is-the-year-of-the-smart-glasses?utm_medium=RSS",
    "summary": "Hey, Four Eyes—why are your glasses so dumb?",
    "content": "We may earn a commission from links on this page. I predict that 2025 will be the year smart glasses break big. The technology is finally advanced enough for tech spectacles to be useful instead of gimmicky; the general public knows what they are; and the new generation of smart glasses look like glasses instead of face computers. We've come a long way since Google Glass. The big tech companies clearly agree, because everyone’s making them: Meta wants to whisper AI in your ear. Google and Snap are joining the fray. Rumors are flying that Samsung and Apple are developing smart glasses. With so many styles, features, and price points hitting the market, it can be overwhelming to figure out what kind of glasses are right for you. Luckily, you don't have to be a tech expert to make a smart choice. What smart glasses can do The term “smart glasses” is a little too broad to be useful. It's used for everything from AI-powered sunglasses to augmented reality displays to glasses that help you see better, so before you buy, it’s worth asking: What exactly do you want your smart glasses to do ? Roughly speaking, smart glasses exist across these categories, although most straddle a few classifications: Audio-first : These are basically earbuds embedded in glasses. They usually look like \"normal\" glasses, and they're designed to play music, take calls, and often to let you talk to an AI assistant. They don’t have screens or AR overlays. Camera-first : These are like a lighter GoPro. They're for people who want to capture life on the fly, either through still images or videos. Some support live-streaming. AR-first : Glasses designed for AR (augmented reality) display digital information like directions, messages, video or even 3D animations directly in your field of view. Vision-first: These are the most future-looking smart glasses. Their purpose isn't to let you listen to podcasts, but to improve your vision. There aren't any vision-first smart glasses on the market in the U.S., but the future could hold cyborg-style vision improvements like automatic zoom, or automatically adjusting bifocals. So those are the basics. Here's the gear: Oakley Meta HSTN Credit: Meta These just-announced smart glasses are Meta's follow-up to its mega-successful line of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Oakley HSTN s do the same things Ray-Ban Metas do—play audio, take photos and videos, allow conversations with Meta's AI agent, and provide real-time language translation—but they do some things better. Oakley smart glasses shoot 3K video compared to Ray-Bans' 1080p, and the eight-hour battery life is twice as long as Meta's. Oakley Metas retail for $399 and you'll be able to pre-order them on July 11. Xreal One Pro Credit: XReal XReal's One Pro smart glasses augment your reality so you can do things like watch a movie from inside your eyeglasses or answer your email on a virtual screen. I was generally impressed with the Xreal Pro line of glasses , and the company's just-released One Pro glasses seem even better. Improvements include an onboard \"Self-Developed Spatial Computing Chip,\" so there's no need for a separate Android device for them to work, and a wider field-of-view for better AR. Xreal Pro One glasses retail for $649.00 and are available now . Viture Pro XR Glasses Credit: Viture/Amazon Designed more for viewing pictures and video than hardcore AR or VR, Viture Pro XR Glasses work as a display for your PC, iPhone or Android device, Steam Deck, Switch 2, and more. The Pro XR displays the equivalent of a 135-inch screen at a distance of 9.8 feet at 1080p. The images are clear and bright, and it's all packed inside a cool-looking pair of shades. Viture Pro XR Glasses are available now for $499.00. Snap Specs Credit: Stephen Johnson Snapchat's smart glasses have come a long way since the first line was released in 2016. Instead of a simple glasses-mounted camera, Snap Specs are a full, standalone AR unit packed in a pair of (clunky-looking) glasses. They come with AI, and allow you to do things like play AR games, share 3D space with others, and project an OS on the palm of your hand. I tried them out briefly at the Augmented World Expo 2025 and they're impressive and easy to use; I can't wait to get a pair. Snap Specs are planned for a 2026 release. No price has been announced. Chamelo Aura Credit: Chamelo I'm not sure Chamelo's Aura sunglasses even count as \"smart glasses,\" but they're so cool, I had to include them. They don't have AI, a camera, speakers, or an in-lens display, but the lenses change between four colors instantly with a click, so you can choose the best tint for light conditions, coordinate your outfits, and impress your friends with your slick glasses. Aura sunglasses retail for $365 and are available now . Google Android XR Glasses Thankfully, Google seems to have put the Google Glass fiasco behind it and is planning to release a pair of Android-powered smart glasses with a camera, Gemini AI support, and an optional see-through micro-display that will let you project info—messages, navigation, and real-time translation—right onto your lenses. Plus, Google has partnered with Warby Parker and Gentle Monster so they won't look dorky. Google Android XR Glasses are expected to be available in 2025-2026. Samsung's Project HAEAN Samsung’s upcoming smart glasses are still under wraps, but the rumors out there are intriguing. Unlike Samsung project Moohan experiment, HAEAN (if real) isn't a big VR helmet. It's a pair of glasses you could wear in public and not feel like a goof. They’re rumored to be powered by Samsung’s in-house XR chip and integrated with Galaxy AI, presumably with the end-goal of a voice and AI-centric wearable with a focus on comfort and wearability. Apple Glass Nothing has been announced officially, but the tech rumor mill is churning with Apple's supposed plan to release a line of smart glasses. If what's been reported in various sources is true, Apple Glass will be like Meta's smart glasses, but better. Maybe better just because they say \"Apple\" on them, but maybe actually better . If these actually exist, the rumor is they'll come out in 2026. IXI Autofocus Smart Glasses It's too early to tell whether this Finnish start-up's claims will turn into vapor, but IXI has recently raised $36.5 million from investors to develop smart glasses that invisibly and automatically adjust to correct farsightedness instead of playing podcasts or whatever. Lenses that automatically adjusted for optimum focus would be a big deal, because the step is glasses that improve on 20/20 eyesight, maybe by allowing long-distance views, or instant microscope eyes. No release date on this, but \"a long way out\" seems logical.",

    "content": "One of the best new Apple Music features in iOS 26 is the ability to pin your favorite songs, albums, or playlists. Finally, you're able to pin your favorites to the top of the library tab, making them easy to access. This is similar to pinning chats in the Messages app , which lets you keep your favorite contacts right at the top. Here's everything you need to know about the new pinning feature in Apple Music . How to pin Apple Music songs in iOS 26 Credit: Pranay Parab Once you've installed iOS 26, pinning your favorite Apple Music content is quite easy. You can pin one song, an album, or a playlist. As long as the music is added to your Apple Music library, you should be able to pin it. Just tap and hold the song, album, or playlist and select the Pin button to pin it. The button will be labelled Pin Song, Pin Album, or Pin Playlist, depending on what you're trying to pin. You can find all these pins in the Music app's Library tab. How to remove pinned items from Apple Music in iOS 26 Credit: Pranay Parab Apple lets you pin a maximum of six items at a time, and once you hit that limit, you'll have to remove a pinned item to add another. Removing a pin is also quite straightforward. Go to the Library tab in Apple Music, long press the pinned item you want to remove, and tap Unpin to remove the pinned item. You can always pin it later if you want to. Customize what happens when you tap a pinned item in Apple Music Credit: Pranay Parab You can choose what happens when you tap a pinned item in Apple Music in iOS 26. The default setting opens albums and playlists, but doesn't play them. Even if you pin a song and tap it, the default is to show you the album that the song is from, but not to play it. You can change this by long pressing the pinned item, selecting Tap Action , and choosing either Play or Shuffle . This way, when you tap the pinned item, Apple Music will play it immediately. Note that the Tap Action is different for each pinned item. You'll have to manually set it up for each item in your pinned list. Choose if you want to automatically download pinned songs Credit: Pranay Parab You can automatically download songs you've pinned in Apple Music in iOS 26. This is enabled by default if you've enabled automatic downloads for Apple Music. But if not, you can toggle this setting easily. Go to Settings > Apps > Music in iOS 26 and scroll down to the Downloads section. You can toggle the Download Pins option here to enable or disable automatic downloads for pinned songs.",

If you’re going to commit to an Amazon Prime membership, you might as well squeeze as much as you can out of the deal. And there's a good amount of juice to squeeze there. The price you pay for Amazon depends on many factors , but regardless of how much you're paying, it's worth it for most people (we did the math). If you're on the fence about signing up, Prime Day , Amazon's biggest sale of the year, is just around the corner. It's a great time to sell your soul—or take advantage of the 30-day free trial . How much does Amazon Prime Cost The standard Prime membership costs $14.99 per month or $139 per year, but there are other tiers that some people might qualify for. For example, the new Amazon Prime Student program allows young adults between the ages of 18 and 24 to get all of the Prime perks for half the cost— $7.49 per month or $69 annually. The benefits of Amazon Prime I'll be the first to admit I didn't know all of the benefits that Amazon Prime offers to its members. There are a lot more perks than people think. Here are the most impressive ones (and here is the full list ): Fast and free shipping Fast free shipping on millions of items : Depending on where you live, shipping can take one or two days, and some even come on the same day—and it’s always free (if being shipped by the Amazon store). Pre-ordered items can be delivered on their release date for free. The option to have items delivered inside your garage with a smart garage device (depending on where you live). Earn rewards for future purchases when you select free no-rush shipping. The option to have all your weekly orders delivered on a specific day, to reduce waste from boxes. The ability to try before you buy when you order clothes or shoes, meaning you have seven days before you get charged for the items you decide to keep.

If you've been wanting to test the waters with outdoor security cameras but didn’t want to go all-in on subscriptions or complicated installs, this Blink deal strikes a nice middle ground. Right now, you can grab the Blink Outdoor 4 camera bundled with the new Sync Module Core for just $39.99 on Amazon. That’s half off the usual price—and the cheapest it’s ever been, according to price trackers . Blink Outdoor 4 (newest model) $39.99 at Amazon $79.99 Save $40.00 Get Deal Get Deal $39.99 at Amazon $79.99 Save $40.00 The Outdoor 4 camera is completely wireless, weather-resistant ( IP65-rated ), and runs on the included AA batteries that can last up to two years, depending on usage. And with 1080p video and a 143-degree field of view, it’s designed to keep an eye on your front porch, driveway, or backyard without much fuss (though you’ll want to manage expectations around image quality in low light). This version pairs with the new Sync Module Core , which is a little hub that keeps things connected and humming. It plugs into a wall outlet inside your home and links your camera to wifi, helping improve battery life and letting you manage settings or view footage in real time through the Blink app. Unlike older modules, the Core doesn’t come with a USB port for local video storage, so if you want to save clips, you’ll need to subscribe to Blink’s cloud plan . A 30-day trial is included; after that, plans start at $3/month for one device or $10/month for unlimited devices per account. If you’d rather skip the cloud, you can upgrade to a separate Sync Module XR or Sync Module 2 and a MicroSD card (up to 256GB) for local backups, all sold separately. Performance-wise, the Outdoor 4 gets solid marks for its price. PCMag's \"Excellent\" review notes improved motion detection over earlier models, thanks to the addition of person detection (though that’s also locked behind the subscription ). Two-way audio is built in, and you can pair it with Alexa to view the feed, arm or disarm, or control other settings using your voice. Just know that it doesn’t work with Google Assistant or HomeKit. All said, this isn’t a full-on outdoor home security system, but if you’re looking for a low-commitment way to monitor a part of your home, it's a deal that’s hard to ignore.",

    "title": "Here's What I Learned After Seven Months of Wearing Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses",
    "link": "https://lifehacker.com/tech/what-i-learned-after-ray-ban-glasses?utm_medium=RSS",
    "summary": "How do Meta's flagship smart glasses stack up after half a year?",
    "content": "We may earn a commission from links on this page. Meta recently announced it's releasing a line of AI-powered Oakley sunglasses to be sold alongside Ray-Ban Metas. According to the company, the new smart glasses have the same basic functions as the old, but the Oakleys have a higher resolution camera (3K vs. 1080p) and a battery that lasts twice as long as the Ray-Bans. Seven months ago, I reviewed the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses . These specs pack a camera, open-ear speakers, microphones, and voice-activated Meta AI inside a pair of Wayfarer-style frames, so they're basically science-fiction glasses that look normal. I liked them so much, I had prescription lenses put in and made them part of my daily load out. But it's easy to love a tech product when it’s new and shiny; the real test is how the Ray-Ban Metas fair after they've gone from novelty to another damn thing I have to remember to charge. Bottom line: I still really like them after over half a year of wearing them while working, sitting around, biking, running errands, and generally living my boring life. But I like them in a more nuanced way. Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses $516.39 Shop Now Shop Now $516.39 Not quite everyday glasses After the initial sugar rush wore off, I started noticing the weight of the Ray-Ban Metas. They're around 49 grams out of the box, fairly heavy for sunglasses, but prescription lenses bumped the weight up to 54 grams. My regular specs are pretty chunky and weigh 39 grams, and the difference is noticeable. They're slightly uncomfortable for extended use. I found myself wearing regular glasses when I didn’t expect to use smart features, and going back to the Ray-Bans if I wanted to take photos, record video, or go hands-free. The main downside was forgetting which pair I was wearing and saying “Hey Meta” to my dumb glasses. (But that’s a me problem.) Build quality, durability, and style: no complaints I have to commend Ray-Ban, Meta, and whatever factory physically built these glasses, because they held up flawlessly. The tech works just as well now as it did when I got them, and the frames themselves held up, too: no warping, bent arms, or other malfunctions. (I didn't necessarily baby them or take special care of them.) They didn't go out of style in the last six months either, seeing as the Wayfarer design is timeless. If they’re good enough for James Dean, they’re good enough for me. Battery life could be better Meta says their smart glasses have a battery life of \"up to four hours,\" which is mildly optimistic—these things need to be charged often. The solution of having a charger built into the glasses' case is acceptable most of the time because the main function of eyeglasses (ensuring I can see things) works even when the batteries run out. But longer outings where I wanted to take lots of photos or videos were a pain. Your choices are to only have pictures of the first half of the graduation ceremony, or pack a back-up pair of glasses so you can charge on the fly. Another battery related annoyance: You can’t disable the low battery notification without disabling all notifications. While that's the case for many tech products, it would be great to have the option to disable it for these glasses. The social factor: Being seen isn't always the best When I first started wearing the Ray-Ban Metas daily, they pretty much flew under people's radars, but as popular awareness of the product grew, so did the people who noticed I was wearing them. More than one person asked “are you taking pictures of me?\" and I didn’t love having my glasses spark conversations about surveillance or Meta’s motives, but I get why some people are wary. They blur the line between fashion and tech in a way that’s still new, and many people find them off-putting. Ray-Ban's many features, ranked and rated Credit: Robyn Johnson The Ray-Ban Meta glasses have a ton of features, and they're not equally useful, so here's a quick feature list, organized from the ones I used most to ones I used least: The camera: Ray-Ban Metas' essential feature for me is the camera. It's weird to think of a smart phone camera as being inconvenient, but reaching in your pocket, unlocking the screen, clicking an app, and putting it up to your face is a lot of steps compared to pinching the arm of your glasses. The other way to turn on the camera, saying “Hey Meta, take a picture” or “Hey Meta, take video,\" can be incredibly useful too, as it lets you take videos while riding a bike and listening to Hawkwind, like so: While I found the quality of the photos to be surprisingly good, these glasses are best for casual snaps. There's no viewfinder, and if you're going for super high quality, or want to shoot in low-light situations, they won't replace a \"real\" camera. Text and calls: Getting a text and replying by voice is great when your hands are full. Initiating or responding to texts while driving is amazing and will probably save some people's lives. Call quality is solid, and the voice recognition is excellent, even in traffic or crowds. It's easy to use too, since you can just say \"Hey Meta, how do I send a text?\" if you forget. Music : Halfway down the list is the perfect time to talk about the Ray-Ban Meta's music and audio. It is mid. The sound quality isn’t terrible, but it's podcast-while-cooking level. If you’re into music at all, you’ll quickly grow tired of the tinny sounds from the Ray-Ban meta glasses and throw in some ear buds. On the plus side, the ability to control Spotify, Apple Music, or Amazon Music with just your voice is great. Saying “Hey Meta, play some funk” and having The Meters start playing is cool. Language translation: Meta recently rolled out the ability to translate from Spanish, French, and Italian to English, and vice-versa. My initial reaction to testing it out with a Spanish speaking pal was \"santa mierda!\" It's really good, and was able to translate spoken words at a conversational rate in real time, with a surprisingly amount of accuracy. I listened to a graduations speech delivered in Spanish, and it translated it perfectly, and I tried it with some Telenovelas on YouTube too. Flawless. Language translation might prove to be smart glasses' killer app. Meta AI : Depending on your point of view, Meta’s AI is the either the killer app or the Trojan horse of these glasses, but I almost never use it. When I first got the glasses, I was blown away by saying “Hey Meta, look” and having it describe what I was seeing accurately. But that wears off after eight minutes. Then, I started using it to clown on my friends by looking at their car or something and saying, “Hey, Meta, is this a nice car?” and relaying the answer. (Sadly, it won't roast people .) That was fun for three minutes. Then, I changed Meta's voice to Awkwafina . That was fun for 38 seconds. Then, I stopped using it altogether. Maybe your life is different, but mine is fine without an AI assistant. What I'd like to see from Ray-Ban Meta glasses Credit: Stephen Johnson These glasses are creeping toward being a true digital assistant, but they're not there. I want to say “Hey, Meta, book me a cheap hotel in Yonkers next weekend” and have it just happen . Right now, though, the glasses are limited to controlling music, sending messages, translating language in real time, and providing basic information—which is a lot for a pair of glasses. Privacy concerns (as if privacy still exists) Meta recently sent an email to Ray-Ban Meta users that said, in part, \"Meta AI with camera use is always enabled on your glasses unless you turn off ‘Hey Meta,'” and “the option to disable voice recordings storage is no longer available.” Basically, Meta is vowing to look at what I'm looking at and store whatever I say, so you could argue there are some pretty big privacy concerns. It’s not great, but honestly, I’m too boring to care. If Meta wants hours of footage of me folding laundry or playing Oblivion Remastered, that’s their problem. If you're someone that does prioritize your privacy though, these glasses are probably not the product for you. Are they worth the price? Whether something is \"worth it\" really depends on the customer. But $299 seems like a good deal for a camera, AI agent, Bluetooth headset, and sunglasses, and if you're going for prescription Ray-Ban Metas, it's amazing. All told, these were actually cheaper than my regular glasses, and I can't ask my regular glasses to tell me a joke. Is it a good time to buy Ray Ban Meta glasses? Last week, I would have said, \"Yes, it's a great time to buy Ray Bans!\" but the announcement of the Meta Oakleys changes my calculations. The newer specs will retail for $399 or $499, where Meta Ray Bans list for $299 or $379—but the Oakleys will have a significantly better camera than the Ray Bans and double the battery life. If you already own a pair of Ray Ban Metas, I don't think it's worth it to buy Oakleys—it'd be nice to have more battery life and a better camera, but it's not vital. If you're buying a new pair of smart glasses, I'd pre-order the Oakleys for sure. Meta hasn't said whether or when it plans to release a pair of Ray Ban Meta glasses with the same specs as the Oakleys, so it's probably not the best time to buy a new pair: There's little worse than buying a tech product the day before a newer, better version is announced. The bottom line I’m not a Meta fanboy by any stretch, but credit where it’s due: These glasses are really good . The novelty wears off, but the usefulness doesn’t. Unlike most gadgets, they've earned their spot in my semi-daily rotation. If they could shave a little more weight off, they'd be my everyday specs.",

    "link": "https://lifehacker.com/money/organizational-triangle-method-transformed-resale-business?utm_medium=RSS",
    "summary": "Maybe I've gone resale-crazy, but at least I'm organized.",
    "content": "I've sold my old stuff online off and on for years, but over the last few months or so, I've gone a little crazy with it. The volume of things I have on hand to sell has increased quite a bit, which means I have hundreds of listings up on Poshmark and other resale sites now—and when someone buys something, I need to be prepared to find it, wash it, and ship it immediately to keep my high seller rating. For a while, this bedeviled me, but then I started using a time-tested organizational method to keep me on track. The Organizational Triangle streamlines my mini-business I am not delusional enough to consider myself a small business owner, but I do put a lot of work into this endeavor and consider my resale presence online a deeply scaled-down version of a regular retail business. If you've ever worked retail, you know that everything is kept highly organized in the stock room (or that it's supposed to be). My apartment is my stock room. Actually, I turned my entire front closet into my stock room—and then I used the principles of the Organizational Triangle to organize it. Those principles are: Every item needs a home. Keep like with like. Use a \"something in, something out\" approach. Every item needs a home This first step involves making sure every single item you have has someplace it belongs. Usually, this involves using boxes or storage bins to keep categories of items separate. I use the shelves of my front closet: Workout and lounge sets are on the top shelf, tops are on the next shelf down, shorts, skirts, and pants are on the next one, and so on. Keeping my resale goods in a designated resale spot , instead of letting them remain in the closet and shelving units I use for my actual wardrobe, makes it easy to access them and keeps them out of sight until I need them. That makes it simpler to organize my real wardrobe, too, since the things I no longer wear are not in there taking up space. Keep like with like Categorization is a major component of organizing in general. Whether you're organizing your kitchen, your work desk, or, in my case, the closet where all your too-big clothes are waiting to be sold to a new owner, you should be grouping categories of items together. I keep categories separated by shelves within that closet, so when someone buys a skirt from me, I know immediately where it will be. Since implementing this step, I've decreased my \"average shipping time,\" which is a metric that counts toward my continued inclusion as a top seller under Poshmark's \"Ambassador\" program. My average ship time went from three days to two because it no longer takes me forever to find the sold item. I can find it the moment it sells, bring it to the laundromat, and have it to the Post Office much faster than before. Use a \"something in, something out\" approach This is the part of the Organizational Triangle I was already using for my resales. For years, when I've wanted something simple—a pink bag, black heels—I've forced myself to first sell the version I have, then use that money to buy a new one. This means I always have something fresh, but I don't have a bunch of similar items clogging up my space. How and why this has helped me with resale I don't love that an entire closet in my small apartment has been taken over, but I know that's temporary as I seek to get rid of the clothes that no longer fit me. Eventually, once they're gone, I can start using a smaller storage nook in my loft, organizing it the same way. What I do love is that keeping everything in a designated spot, organizing it by category, and prioritizing a one-out-one-in approach has streamlined my process. I'm also a resale buyer, not just a seller. On a handful of occasions, I've purchased an item, waited days for it to ship, and ended up disappointed when the other person messaged me to say they \"couldn't find\" the thing I bought. I know we're all human, but it's still bad customer service and it sucks. I don't want to do that to anyone else. I sell mostly on Poshmark, where feedback from buyers is optional but public. My buyers have included notes that say I'm a fast, efficient, friendly shipper who sends out clean, nice goods as described. I've definitely received more positive reviews since restructuring with the Organizational Triangle. The items waiting to sell are safe and secure in the \"resale closet\"; I can quickly find and wash them; and my entire process has been sped up. Positive reviews mean more sales—and more sales mean I'll have that closet cleared out in no time, earn money to buy clothes that fit me better, and succeed more in my endeavor.",

    "link": "https://lifehacker.com/food-drink/how-to-use-self-rising-flour-for-an-egg-free-fried-chicken-crust?utm_medium=RSS",
    "summary": "It's always been there on the grocery store shelf, waiting for you.",
    "content": "The only bad fried chicken is soggy fried chicken. (And even then, honestly, a quick air fry’ll fix it right up.) However, there are indisputably great ways to get a crackling crust, and those should always be considered. For example, the karaage method or the copycat fast food method . There is another fried chicken trick that I’ve recently become aware of, and unlike the other two I mentioned, this one has no extra steps. There’s no three-part batter, and it doesn’t require a dip in a bowl of (still pricey) eggs. It’s one step with a simple flour swap, and it changes everything. Self-rising flour is key I’ve always used regular all-purpose flour to fry, or potato flour for its superior crisping qualities, but self-rising flour was a complete surprise. This flour, ever-present on my grocery store’s shelves, never seemed to be much use to me. For those who also don’t use it much, self-rising flour consists of a reliable ratio of all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt. So if you wanted to make a quick pancake recipe, you could use a scoop of this stuff and skip adding those other two ingredients to your recipe. I know that folks in the UK use it often, but I’ve always shied away from not being able to control the leavening agent and salt in my baking. But while reading the recipes in Still We Rise , a fantastic cookbook with biscuit recipes and recipes for other things you’d enjoy with a biscuit nearby, I came across the Glori-Fried Chicken Biscuit Sandwich. You guessed it: The recipe uses self-rising flour. Credit: Allie Chanthorn Reinmann An easy, light, and crispy coating Following the recipe, there is a section of notes called The Gospel of Fried Chicken, and Council (the author) briefly describes why self-rising flour works. The included salt boosts the flavor—no surprises there—but the baking powder plays a large role in giving a thin, shattering crust to the fried chicken. There’s no need for multiple dredges through flour or egg washes to make the crust as brilliant as it is. As a leavening agent, baking powder has the duty to lift up and aerate our cakes and muffins, but it does this even in that thin layer coating your chicken. When hydrated and heated up, the baking powder reacts and produces carbon dioxide. This looks like tiny little bubbles in cakes, but on chicken it produces a delicate, rippling crust. How to use self-rising flour for fried chicken 1. Brine Whenever I fry chicken, I prefer to do a buttermilk brine if time affords it. Yogurt will work too, and that’s usually what I use. Even one hour can make a difference in how juicy and tender the chicken will be. I brined some skin-on chicken drumsticks in yogurt with a pinch of salt for about an hour. Then I prepared my flour dredge. 2. Coat the chicken I mixed about three-quarters of a cup of self-rising flour with a half-teaspoon of salt (a little extra is necessary for fried chicken), a teaspoon of cornstarch (which provides extra starch for crunch ), and a sprinkle of garlic and onion powder. Credit: Allie Chanthorn Reinmann Then comes the easy part: coating the chicken. I put one drumstick at a time into the flour and coated it completely. Just one time. Then let them dry on a wire rack while I heated the oil. 3. Fry the chicken I heated up about an inch of cooking oil in a dutch oven until it reached 350°F and fried until they were deeply browned on all sides and the internal temperature reached 160°F (carryover cooking—that is, when food continues to cook off the heat for several minutes—takes care of the remaining five degrees to get it to 165°F). With truly the least effort I’ve ever put into fried chicken, I made a batch of the best drumsticks I’ve had in a long time. And with picnics and backyard parties coming up, you deserve this ease too. Although I haven’t tried this self-rising flour coating on other fried morsels, like chicken tenders, eggplant, tofu, or zucchini planks, I trust that it would work just as well. Actually, I think I have a pack of tofu in the fridge right now. I know what I must do. If you want more egg-free alternatives while prices are still high, I've tested other ideas, including: The Five Best Egg Replacements I've Used for Baking (so Far ) I Tested Boxed Cake Mix Without the Eggs, and It Was Fantastic Sour Cream Makes for a Better Egg Wash Than an Actual Egg Eggless Breakfasts to Fuel Your Day (and Spare Your Wallet) All the Ways Chickpea Liquid Can Replace Eggs in Dessert Recipes",

    "link": "https://lifehacker.com/tech/iphone-wallet-app-f1-movie-ad?utm_medium=RSS",
    "summary": "The downside: You need to be running iOS 26.",
    "content": "No one likes ads, but they do have their time and a place. If you click on an article, you probably won't be surprised to see them displayed alongside it (unless you have an ad blocker in place, of course). But when your apps start pinging you not with relevant notifications, but with unasked for advertisements, that's a different story. That's what some Apple Wallet users experienced today, when the app that's supposed to handle mobile payments pinged them with an ad for Apple's upcoming racing film F1: The Movie . According to a screenshot from this Reddit user , the ad reads: \"$10 off at Fandango: Save on 2+ tickets to F1 The Movie with APPLEPAYTEN. Ends 6/29. While supplies last. Terms apply.\" A good deal, maybe, but users are not pleased. Put aside the fact that critics seem to be enjoying F1 — no one enjoys unsolicited ads, especially from apps that abuse the notification system. Wallet is far from the only app to take this road (here's looking at you, Snapchat) which is why I tend to disable notifications for all but the most essential apps . But what makes this even worse is this is one of Apple's own system apps advertising one of Apple's original films. It feels wrong that Apple can take control of the notifications for one of its apps to tell you to see a movie it produced, just because you happened to buy a smartphone made by Apple. As one user put it , \"I did not pay over [$1,000] for an iPhone to get advertised at.\" Unfortunately, that might just be part of the package: Apple has been adding ads to its own apps and services since 2022 , something you might have noticed when browsing the App Store or the Apple News app. Ping notifications are definitely a rarity for Apple, and I hope it stays that way, but Apple might see it in its own best interest to advertise as it wishes across its platforms and services—even if it's not in the best interest of its customers. Luckily, there's something you can do about it—eventually, anyway. How to disable Apple Wallet's ads Yes, there is a way to disable these new obtrusive ads without turning off Wallet notifications entirely—you just need to be running the right version of iOS. As it turns out, Apple has added a new notification setting to Wallet in iOS 26, which is currently in beta testing . While I do not recommend installing the beta at this time, especially not solely for disabling Wallet ads, here's how the setting works: Open the Wallet app, tap the three dots in the top right, then choose Notifications . Here, disable the toggle for Offers & Promotions. That should block these ads from showing up in the future—at least in Wallet. Comment by u/african-nightmare from discussion in iphone Perhaps at the end of the day, Apple is still the winner in all of this. Not only does this story bring extra attention to Apple's new movie, it also highlights a new quality-of-life feature in iOS 26. Sure, people are pissed, but they got us talking about two different Apple products today. Touché, Apple.",

The last sale was in the spring , around the time of Amazon's Big Spring Sale. When is Circle Week? The next Circle Week will take place from July 6 to July 12. That means it begins two days before Prime Day and ends one day after Prime Day. Do you need to be a member to shop the sales during Target Circle Week? Like Amazon's Prime Day sale, you will need to be a Circle member to take part in the sale, but unlike a Prime membership, Target Circle is free. You can sign up for an account on the Target app or Target.com . You can also pay for a Target Circle 360 membership, which grants you early access to the sale as well as other perks, like same-day delivery. If you're a teacher or student, you can save 50% on the one-year Circle 360 subscription through Sept. 13; otherwise, it starts at $10.99 per month. But again, a paid membership isn't necessary to get all the best Circle Week deals. What deals can I find during Target Circle Week? Circle week will focus on back-to-school items and college essentials like classroom products, dorm décor, and on-trend apparel, but you'll also find tech products on sale. You can shop in person or online, and there will be a \"Deal of the Day\" for every day of the event. While Target hasn't released a list of deals you can expect, you can get a pretty good idea from past Circle Week sales. Here are some of the deals they had at the tail end of the Circle Week last fall . What competitors are also offering sales? Amazon’s Prime Day will take place between July 8 and July 11, so all the other sales tend to revolve around these dates. Walmart has its Walmart Deals sale from July 8 through July 13, while Best Buy's 'Black Friday in July' sale is running from July 7 through July 13.",

If you're looking to protect your property with an outdoor security camera, the Reolink 4K Wired Outdoor Security Camera is a strong contender, and right now, you can get it for $50 off (with coupon) on Amazon. With features that rival those of more expensive competitors, this wired camera is designed for people who want comprehensive surveillance without too much fuss. Reolink 4K Wired Outdoor Security Camera $134.99 at Amazon $184.99 Save $50.00 Get Deal Get Deal $134.99 at Amazon $184.99 Save $50.00 Users appreciate the sharp 4K dual‑lens image quality, which includes an 8MP wide-angle lens and built-in spotlights for crisp, colorful footage—even on dark nights. One standout feature is its ability to pan and tilt (355°/90°) with a 6x hybrid zoom that can track subjects up to 50 feet away. Whether you’re monitoring vehicles, people, or pets, it offers an ultra-wide field of view—ranging from 104° to 38° horizontally and 60° to 21° vertically—for full-coverage surveillance. The camera’s dual-band wifi supports both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz networks, and it offers flexible storage options: up to 256GB via microSD (not included), FTP, or a Reolink NVR. Two-way audio allows you to hear what’s going on outside your home and speak to anyone who approaches. A time-lapse function is a nice bonus, letting you compress hours of footage into just a few minutes for a quick overview. That said, the dual-band wifi has received mixed feedback, with some customers noting occasional connectivity issues. While images are crisp overall, some say clarity degrades and gets blurry when zoomed beyond 2.7x. Some false detections may also be triggered by sensitive motion or noise detection, especially in windy conditions. And since this is a wired camera, it does require a constant power source via an adapter. Ultimately, while the Reolink 4K Wired Outdoor Security Camera is on the expensive side compared to budget outdoor surveillance cameras, it offers solid bang for your buck, especially if you don’t want to commit to subscription fees.",

    "summary": "Don't let your home gym become home décor.",
    "content": "We may earn a commission from links on this page. The struggle with any piece of home-gym equipment is finding the motivation to actually put it to good use. As I wrote in my initial review , the Merach Mini Stepper isn't exactly a demanding workout. It's perfect for meeting modest fitness goals or anyone trying to sneak in gentle movement throughout the day. But to achieve this, you do need to make sure you're using your mini stepper for stepping—and not as home décor . The key to actually using your mini stepper (or any piece of workout equipment) consistently lies in setting yourself up for success from day one. Here are the steps to take to transform your mini stepper from a good intention into a daily habit. Find your perfect spot I keep my mini-stepper between my living room chair and couch. Credit: Meredith Dietz I think the biggest mistake you can make is treating your mini stepper or other workout machine like a piece of luggage, storing it away after each use. Instead, designate a permanent spot where it can live full-time. I promise, it won't be an eyesore . A corner of your living room, bedroom, or home office works perfectly. The easier it is to access, the more likely you'll actually use it. I keep my mini-stepper between my living room chair and couch—perfect to scoot our and get some steps in while I watch TV, because stepping in place can feel monotonous without proper distraction. Create an entertainment zone around your stepper, or position it so you're doing anything but staring at the wall. Adjust your settings This mini stepper has two main modes: Stepping up-and-down or twisting side-to-side. When the lever is down, as shown in the photo below, you're set to twist. This twisting motion feels less like a stair climber, and more like you're trying to ski. I know I feel it more in my glutes to keep myself stable during this movement. Push the lever down to twist side to side. Credit: Meredith Dietz When the lever is up as shown here, you can step up and down. This feels more like climbing stairs, and is definitely the choice for a gentler, more familiar motion. Pull the lever up to go up and down. Credit: Meredith Dietz You also have the option to clip on your resistance bands, which I highly recommend to engage your upper body. Otherwise, you might just keep your hands on your hips to maintain a sense of stability. Clip on your resistance bands. Credit: Meredith Dietz Make sure you're using a mode that will hope you meet your fitness goals and that you don't hate so much you'll avoid exercising in the first place. Set up your display and monitoring The mini stepper has a basic LCD display that tracks steps, time, and an approximation of calories burned. Of course, like with ellipticals in the gym, the calorie estimates are wildly optimistic —you're best off just ignoring those. In fact, I'm the type to cover equipment displays during workouts to prevent obsessive clock-watching. Other times, seeing that step number go up is exactly what I need for motivation. Yeah, 18 steps in 39 seconds. Apologies for flexing like this. Credit: Meredith Dietz Experiment to see what works for you. Press the button once to turn the display on, and then again to toggle through reps per minute, calories, and the duration of your workout. The total step count at the top is untouchable, so if you don't want to see that, you'll have to cover up the whole screen. Perfect your form Proper form on your Merach Mini Stepper starts with understanding the pedal design. The textured foot pads are designed to accommodate your entire foot—not just the balls of your feet. Place majority of your foot securely on the platform to engage your entire leg and provides better stability. Keep your weight evenly distributed across both feet, and avoid favoring one side. Your stepping motion should be deliberate and controlled: Imagine you're climbing actual stairs rather than bouncing rapidly. Each step should have a brief pause at the bottom to ensure you're not just bouncing on the balls of your feet. When you're starting out, find a comfortable pace that you can maintain throughout your workout. Most beginners benefit from 60-80 steps per minute, while more advanced users might work up to 100+ steps per minute. This dual-action mini stepper has hydraulic cylinders as opposed to a manual resistance knobs or levers. system. The resistance should feel smooth and consistent, not jerky or overly difficult. If you hear unusual sounds or feel uneven resistance between pedals, check that both cylinders are in place. Set realistic goals Like with any sort of fitness goal, resist the temptation to go all-out on day one. Begin with 10-15 minute sessions and gradually increase by 2-3 minutes each week. Don't be the sort of person who abandons your stepper because it you set an unrealistic goal and lost interest or motivation. If you want to build a long-term habit, consistency trumps intensity. The best way to tackle this is to plan a workout schedule—whatever that looks like for you. You might follow a workout video , or simply commit to incorporating your stepper into your nightly TV routine. Morning steppers often find it easier to maintain consistency since fewer daily obstacles arise early in the day. Evening steppers can use it as a way to decompress from work. The best strategy is whichever one helps you stick to your habit. Create a workout ritual As a marathon runner, I swear by pre-workout rituals. This might include putting on your workout clothes, filling up your water bottle, queuing up your entertainment, and doing a few dynamic stretches. Having a consistent pre-workout ritual signals to your brain that it's exercise time and helps transition you into the right mindset. As mentioned above, it helps to dedicate a show, podcast, or playlist exclusively for your stepping sessions. Anything that creates a positive association and motivation to exercise. Track your progress Whether you use a fitness app, wall calendar, or simple notebook, tracking your stepper sessions provides powerful motivation. Personally, I use a spreadsheet . Record the date, duration, and how you felt during each workout. If I've learned anything from Duolingo, it's that seeing your consistency streak grow creates psychological momentum.

Maybe you'll get sick, go on vacation, or face a particularly busy work period. Decide in advance how you'll handle these situations. Perhaps you'll commit to doing shorter 5-minute sessions when pressed for time, or set a reminder to return to your habit when you're back from vacation. Having a plan for overcoming these obstacles prevents temporary breaks from becoming permanent abandonment. Remember, the best piece of exercise equipment is the one you actually use.",

    "summary": "Fake numbers are being displayed on real company websites.",
    "content": "It's reasonable to assume that if you reach out to tech support from a legitimate help website, you'll be speaking with a real customer service representative. However, scammers are hijacking pages belonging to companies like Netflix, PayPal, and Apple with the goal of stealing your information or gaining remote access to your device. Malwarebytes Labs has identified a tech support scam that uses malicious URLs to embed fake phone numbers within legitimate site searches. Here's how to identify and avoid falling victim to this attack. How scammers are hijacking customer support pages This scam begins, as many do, with a sponsored ad on Google. If you search for a company's tech support phone number, you may see several (fake) results near the top of the page. Often, clicking these links will take you to a fake phishing website that you can identify by checking the URL, but in some cases, you'll actually land on the legitimate support page with little cause for suspicion. However, the number displayed may be fraudulent, and if you call, you'll reach scammers rather than tech support. This type of attack allows cybercriminals to embed phone numbers within an authentic site, where they are prominently displayed. Once on the phone, scammers will request login credentials, financial account information, or even remote access to your device. Because the URL is legitimate and the page layout authentic, you may not think twice about calling the number. Malwarebytes has found this attack on sites that include Netflix, PayPal, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Bank of America, and HP. Red flags for hijacked tech support sites Now that you know that this scam is possible, there are a few signs to watch for. First, check your browser's address bar. There is likely a phone number with lots of encoded characters (%20 or %2B) and/or text like \"call now\" or \"emergency support\" in the URL. If the website shows search results and you didn't enter a search term in the on-page search bar, it may be a scam. As always, any language that sounds urgent should also raise suspicion. Unfortunately, this isn't the only way that scammers can impersonate legitimate companies. With call spoofing , fake calls can appear to come from real, known numbers, so if you receive a call back from \"tech support\" and google the number, it'll show up as the actual company support line. If anything feels off—there's a sense of urgency or the caller asks for personal information or requests access to your device—hang up. To avoid this, look for company phone numbers by navigating directly to the home page or checking official social media channels. You can also look for contact information in past communication from the company or by logging into your account. Do not rely on search results.",

    "link": "https://lifehacker.com/tech/favorite-new-features-and-changes-in-the-second-ios-26-beta?utm_medium=RSS",
    "summary": "A new look for Control Center, and a new ringtone for your iPhone.",
    "content": "On Monday, Apple released its second developer beta for iOS 26. While the update is mostly here to fix bugs and glitches found in the first beta, Apple did take the opportunity to include some new features and changes that weren't ready for beta 1—at least eight, in fact. To be clear, iOS 26 is currently in beta testing , and is not generally available to the public yet. What's more, this is the developer beta, which is meant for software developers to test their apps within Apple's new OS. While anyone can install the beta on their iPhones, I do not recommend it, as it's still too unstable. You may find your iPhone unusable or lose data if you uninstall the beta without a proper backup . Whether you're running the beta or you're just curious about what's new, here are eight of my favorite features and changes I've seen reported from Apple's second iOS 26 beta. Control Center's Liquid Glass effect The first thing you'll probably notice when you install iOS 26 on your iPhone (or any of Apple's upcoming updates, really) is the new Liquid Glass design. It's hard to miss: All of the UI elements—including menu bars, windows, and buttons—now take on a \"glassy\" effect that shows the elements behind them, albeit blurred and distorted. While there are plenty of opinions about this redesign, I think it's pretty cool, and it's refreshing to see Apple mix up its design in a major way for the first time in over a decade. That said, the initial design that rolled out with the first iOS 26 beta wasn't perfect. Control Center, in particular, was a bit of a mess: As usual, it features a grid of tiles, only now they're made of \"glass,\" letting in too much of the background. It's difficult to see; it's messy; it's just not very Apple. The company clearly went back to the drawing board for beta 2, because Control Center now looks way different . Apple significantly reduced the transparency effect, to the point where I wouldn't blame you for thinking nothing had changed from iOS 18 at all. This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed. It's objectively easier to see the tiles now, but I do wonder if Apple could strike a better balance here. I appreciate the need for visibility and simplicity, but I do like the new glassy look, and it'd be a shame if that design was compromised by the need to reduce the effect too often. It's still early yet, so we'll see where Liquid Glass ends up at the end of beta testing. The transparency can be reduced even more Before Apple toned down Control Center's Liquid Glass effect in beta 2, beta testers were looking for ways to reduce the effect on their own. As it happens, \"Reduce Transparency,\" an existing accessibility feature, gets the job done , cutting down on the transparent effects throughout iOS. With the latest beta, Apple has boosted Reduce Transparency's effects even more. It seems like this is going to be the official workaround for limiting Apple's new design, at least at this point. A new ringtone Apple last updated its ringtone selection with iOS 17 back in 2023 . Before that, its tones had stayed the same since iOS 7, save for \" Reflection ,\" the ringtone Apple shipped with the iPhone X in 2017. Reflection is now the default ringtone on all iPhones, and while you can change it to any of Apple's other tones ( or even one of your own ), the company would prefer you have another version of Reflection to work with . With beta 2, Apple added Alt 1 as an option under Reflection, with the original ringtone now labeled as \"Default.\" As it happens, the new ringtone was spotted in the IPSW file of the first beta, but Apple only added it to the ringtone settings with this latest update. You can hear the new ringtone below. I think it's pretty great, though I'm not sure why Apple was dead-set on calling this an alternate version of Reflection. It sounds different enough to me that it could have been its own ringtone. This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed. A new \"Live Radio\" widget Apple Music has a new Home Screen widget: Live Radio . If you frequently listen to Apple Music's various radio stations, you can add this widget to your iPhone's Home Screen to select a station without needing to open Apple Music first. Safari's tab options are back With the first iOS 26 beta, Apple's redesigned Safari also moved the placement of the tab buttons. If you're using an iPhone with iOS 18, you're likely used to these options being on the bottom of the screen. That's not the case with iOS 26, as Apple moved them to the top. Perhaps Apple received one too many complaints from beta testers whose muscle memories failed them while browsing the web, because these buttons are now back on the bottom . We now know what Low Power Mode really does You might use Low Power Mode to eke out as much time as possible when your iPhone's battery starts to die—but do you really know what the feature is doing? We've only been able to speculate up until this point, as the current description in iOS 18 says: \"Low Power Mode temporarily reduces background activity like downloads and mail fetch until you can fully charge your iPhone.\" But it clearly does more than this, as anyone with a high-refresh rate iPhone can attest that Low Power Mode cuts the refresh rate of 120Hz to 60Hz. iOS 26 beta 2 gives us much more detail, per MacRumors . The description now reads: \"iPhone will temporarily reduce some background activities, processing speed, display refresh rate and brightness, and limit certain features such as 5G, iCloud syncing, mail fetch, and more.\" While this still might not cover all bases, Apple is now confirming that Low Power Mode not only stops apps from running in the background, but also does things like reduce processing speed and limit demanding cellular connections. Order tracking in Apple Wallet is now live Apple originally announced the ability to track your orders in Apple Wallet during WWDC , but as of beta 2, the feature is now live. When you update, you'll see an option to scan the Mail app for orders from companies, which will then appear in Wallet. You can see which orders have been placed, which have shipped, and which are out for delivery. Apple confirms you can restore your iPhone without a Mac or PC As MacRumors reports , the initial iOS 26 beta contained the ability to restore your iPhone without a separate computer—a first for Apple. But with beta 2, Apple confirmed the change in its release notes, saying: \"Recovery Assistant is a new way to recover your device if it doesn't start up normally. It can look for problems and attempt to resolve them if found.\"",

    "content": "The Camera app has gotten a few useful upgrades in iOS 26 . From a brand new app icon to a more convenient layout, there's a lot to check out . I've been using the new app for a couple of weeks, and here's every helpful change I've found so far. A slick interface Credit: Pranay Parab I'm liking Apple's updates to the Camera app's UI. It's neater and a lot less confusing upon opening the app. At first, there are just the two options—Photo and Video—for you to choose from, which makes it really easy to jump right into action. Once you choose how you want to use your camera, you can then access additional options on the same screen, and Apple has reduced the number of times you'll have to go to your iPhone's Settings page for Camera-related tweaks, like choosing which format you want your videos to be saved in. You also have the option of swiping on the Photo or Video buttons to reveal more camera modes. However, my favorite feature is that long-pressing the name of your current camera mode reveals even more options, such as adjusting the exposure, toggling night mode, tweaking the focus, and much more. Adjust video settings in the Camera app Credit: Pranay Parab Up until iOS 18, shooting videos could get frustrating pretty quickly. Most of the time, I was still fine, since I only needed to shoot in the default of 1080p in 30 fps. But when I wanted to shoot a 60 fps video, I had to start digging through my Setting app. That has changed in iOS 26. When you open the Camera app in iOS 26 and select the Video mode, you'll see video format details in the top-left corner of the screen. Tap this to quickly change the resolution and frame rate. This is an excellent feature for anyone who regularly uses their iPhone to shoot videos. Control your camera with your AirPods Credit: Pranay Parab If you have an iPhone running iOS 26 that's paired with either a pair of AirPods 4 or AirPods Pro 2, you can use your headphones as a camera remote . Open the Camera app on your iPhone and press the AirPods stem to click a photo or start/stop a video recording. This is really convenient for the times when you need to take photos from an awkward angle, or when you want to take a nice photo of yourself from a distance. Enable camera adjustments with the Camera Control button Credit: Khamosh Pathak Many of us now have an iPhone with a Camera Control button (iPhone 16, 16 Plus, 16 Pro, and 16 Pro Max). In iOS 26, the Camera Control button defaults to launching the camera and letting you switch from one camera mode to another. But if you want to tweak other settings while taking photos, you can now go to Settings > Camera > Camera Adjustments and enable Camera Adjustments . On this page, you can select the controls you want to access, too. These include Exposure, Depth, Zoom, Styles, and Tone. Get a reminder to clean your camera Credit: Khamosh Pathak With iOS 26, your iPhone can also remind you to clean the camera lens when it's dirty . This feature is called Lens Cleaning Hints, and it's available on the iPhone 15 Pro and beyond (which suggests that it may be linked to AI, as those are the phones that are compatible with Apple Intelligence). When your lens is dirty, your iPhone will show a small popover notification at the top of the viewfinder, reminding you to clean it. Once that's done, the popover will disappear. Luckily, if that sounds annoying to you, you can toggle this feature on or off by going to Settings > Camera > Lens Cleaning Hints .",

    "summary": "Plus, what's going on with the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7?",
    "content": "With Google I/O and WWDC out of the way, the next big tech event of the year is Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy Unpacked , which the company has now confirmed will take place on July 9. (Doesn't Samsung know everyone will be busy with Prime Day?) Following a previous Unpacked event focused on the Galaxy S25 series, this upcoming announcement is set to focus on the company’s newest foldable phones, likely including a look at long-rumored Ultra model. This follows precedent—Samsung usually announces its foldable phones around mid-year. While Samsung won't confirm details until the day of, the announcement headline reads “Galaxy Unpacked July 2025: The Ultra Experience Is Ready to Unfold.” Plus, a teaser posted to Samsung’s YouTube closes with the line “Ultra Unfolds.” So I think it's pretty clear what we can expect. But even if the company has essentially already let the biggest cat out of the bag, that doesn’t mean there won’t be additional surprises in store. Here’s how to watch the next Samsung Galaxy Unpacked, and what announcements you can expect. How to Watch the next Samsung Galaxy Unpacked The next Samsung Galaxy Unpacked will take place on July 9 at 10 a.m. ET. Like past Samsung announcements, you’ll be able to follow along live on either Samsung.com or Samsung’s own YouTube channel . In person, it’ll be hosted in at a venue in Brooklyn, New York, although it won’t be open to the public. (Lifehacker will bring you the latest news from Galaxy Unpacked as it becomes available.) What to expect from the next Samsung Galaxy Unpacked As Samsung has all but confirmed, this summer's event will most definitely be all about foldables. That means we’ll probably get our first glimpses at the seventh Galaxy Z Fold and Flip devices, although it’s unclear what form they’ll take. An \"Ultra\" foldable? Samsung’s invitation, plus a now deleted post from earlier this month , point to an Ultra-branded foldable showing up at some point, but what we don’t know is whether it will release in addition to the current Z Fold and Flip lines, or if it will replace one or both entirely. Personally, I’d lean toward the Ultra being a new option in addition to base models of the Z Fold 7 and Flip 7, but other Android foldables have taken the latter approach, most notably the Pixel 9 Pro Fold . What leaks and rumors tell us about Samsung's new foldables Regardless of whatever Samsung’s new device or devices are called, here's what we already know: In February , Android Headlines worked with leaker OnLeaks to post CAD renders of what it suspected to be the Galaxy Z Fold 7, and late last week , the site posted what it’s calling official renders as well. It’s still calling this phone the Fold 7, so it’s possible the Ultra will be something else entirely, although it’s telling that if it is, nothing about it has leaked. Perhaps Samsung is just renaming the Fold 7 to include \"Ultra\" in the name? A thinner foldable As for the renders, the biggest takeaway is that this phone is likely to be thinner than the Z Fold 6, “anywhere from 3.9mm to 4.5mm thin when unfolded.” By comparison, the current model is 5.6mm thin when unfolded, while a recent competing foldable, the Oppo Find N5 , is 4.2mm when unfolded. The return of the pinhole camera Also notable is that the under-display pinhole camera on the internal display seems to have been replaced with a punch hole camera, likely to improve quality. This will mean a slight interruption to your screen space, although it still takes up less real estate than the iPhone’s Dynamic Island. A new screen shape The external display also looks a little wider as well, with an aspect ratio more akin to the main display on a non-folding phone. If the leaks come to pass, expect it to be 6.5-inches large overall. And with that wider external display also means a slightly larger, 8.2-inch internal screen, which would be the largest on a foldable. A status quo processor Leaks aren’t expecting a major power increase, expecting the phone to run the same Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip that’s in the Galaxy S25 series of phones. Despite the phone being thinner, battery capacity should match prior generations, though. A major camera upgrade—maybe? One of the leaks’ bigger called shots relates to the camera, which Android Headlines says will upgrade to a 200MP primary sensor. That might be where the Ultra name is coming from—that sensor is one of the biggest differentiators on recent non-folding Samsung Ultra-branded phones. I’m a bit skeptical, since foldables usually sacrifice camera quality to achieve their form factor, but if this bears fruit, it’ll essentially negate one of the biggest reasons to stick with a non-folding phone. Maybe there won’t be a base Fold 7 after all, if it’s set to have a camera this good. A new Galaxy Z Flip 7 As for whatever Samsung’s next flip phone will be, leaked details are a bit more sparse. It does seem like one is on the way, and animation renders from Android Headlines and Onleaks point to it having a larger external display more akin to Motorola’s Razr . That means it’ll extend around the dual camera lenses for a total of 3.6-inches of screen space overall. The inner display is also set to gain an inch, hitting 6.8-inches, although thickness should remain the same. The phone as a whole might be a little wider, at 75.2mm, but other dimensions should be roughly equivalent to the Z Flip 6, as should camera specs. Processor details aren’t yet known. What the new devices will cost Pricing is a bit contentious. While Android Headlines’ posts and a statement from leaker PandaFlashPro claim that prices will stay the same as with previous models, a more recent leak originating from NieuweMobiel and shared by SamMobile showed that an Italian retailer posted a €200 price increase for what it listed as the Fold 7 and a €100 price increase for the Flip 7, which would take the new phones to €2,227 and €1,425, respectively. However, it’s possible that this discrepancy could stem from regional differences, a mistake on either the leaker or retailer’s part, or confusion stemming from that rumored new Ultra model. For concrete details, we’ll just have to wait until July 9. Stay tuned for more updates.",

    "summary": "When you're exercising solo, accountability is key.",
    "content": "We may earn a commission from links on this page. I teach spin classes in a gym setting, so I probably sound biased when I say that in-person exercise classes offer indisputable benefits over at-home workouts, but I don't think I'm overstating things. Going to a gym involves multiple baked-in factors to keep you accountable, from the monthly membership fee to the social pressure or working out in a group setting. When you work out at home, you have more flexibility, but you can flex yourself right into not exercising at all. That's not to say I'm against working out at home. I love my Peloton Bike and ride it every day, and I think one reason for that is the company does a great job of finding ways to make users want to stay on track, even when exercising solo. Today, I hit the milestone of a 100-day Peloton workout streak, and while streaks are effective at motivating my lizard brain, Peloton offers much more than that—including a feature called Teams that lets you compete with or against your friends or other Peloton users. In recent weeks, I've been testing it out, and I've discovered that Teams is truly effective at creating that in-gym feeling of motivation. How Peloton Teams works Using Teams, you can work out with friends (or even like-minded strangers), either working jointly toward a pre-determined goal (say, a collective 100 hours of cycling in a month) or competing head-to-head. Your \"team\" is a group united by whatever you decide—it can be your friend group, or a group of people who share a common identifier, like being from a certain geographical area or getting back into exercise after giving birth. In short, the feature creates a sense of community in a virtual landscape that can sometimes feel isolating, and it's easy to access from the Peloton app. How to set up a Peloton Team To set up a Peloton Team, start in the Peloton app on your phone . Along the bottom menu on the home screen, you'll see icons for Home and Classes , an icon that lets you Track an activity on the fly, a Community icon, and a Profile icon. Tap the Community icon (it looks like three silhouetted people standing together) and the next screen will give you three options : Teams , Feed , and Challenges. Under Teams , you'll see any Teams you're on, plus the option to Create one. When you tap Create a Team , you'll be asked to name it, give it a description, select a color to represent the group, and pick activities for everyone to focus on. You can choose from strength, yoga, meditation, cardio, and more—or you can pick \"all.\" Then, indicate where the Team is based from a list of major cities, or select \"anywhere.\" Finally, decide if the Team is public or private. Public Teams have activity data available for view by anyone, and anyone can join them. Private Teams are more, well, private, with progress only visible to members. Team admins determine who is allowed to join a private Team. Credit: Lindsey Ellefson Once you're done with the basic setup, you'll be taken to a page that shows you the details of the team across five tabs: Overview , Feed , Challenges , Weekly stats , and Teammates . There are a few ways to add teammates—tap the icon at the top with a silhouette and a plus sign, or the button that says Invite friends on the Overview and Teammates tabs. Tapping any of those brings you to a list of the people who follow you on Peloton, and you'll see an Invite button next to their name. You can also share the invite link to people with whom you aren't connected on the app, so you can text it to a friend or post it in a forum. Who can be on your Peloton Team Anyone with a Peloton membership can be on your Peloton Team. Memberships range from $12.99 per month if you're just using the app to do things like yoga and stretching, to $44 per month if you have Peloton equipment (like a Bike, Bike+, Tread, or Row) and want to access classes, games, and other features. I have the All Access membership, which enables me to do everything from follow along with guided walks on my phone to playing a beat-based game on my Bike called Lanebreak . I recently began testing out a Bike+ , the upgraded at-home stationary cycle, and I set up my boyfriend with an All Access membership to use on my old Bike so we could test out features like taking classes together . We formed a Team on the first day, though we could have done so even without owning two Pelotons, as app-only members can also participate. What you do once you've made a Team After you've invited your teammates, it's time to set up some challenges and competitions. Your team will is a permanent fixture, but the challenges and competitions are timed. Say you set a week-long challenge where everyone works to complete a combined 25 workouts: After a week, that challenge will disappear, but the team itself will remain. You can do more than one challenge at a time, and add new ones whenever one expires. Credit: Lindsey Ellefson There are two options when creating an activity: Challenges create a \"shared target goal\" that everyone works toward, like the completion of a set number of workouts, a set distance traveled, or a set amount of time spent exercising. Competitions allow you to set those same workout- or time-based goals, but you're all competing against one another to see who can do the most in a fixed amount of time. You can check progress on your challenges and competitions from the Overview tab, and get a more detailed view by checking the Challenges and Weekly Stats tabs. The Feed tab shows you everyone's workouts. You can send virtual high-fives to your teammates through the app, too, to keep everyone motivated. Find a Team to join If you don't have a group of Peloton-owning friends, you can join Teams with strangers. From the Community tab in the app, tap the Discover button. There, you'll find trending teams and featured public teams across a wide variety of classifications—Pregnant Pelo Mamas, TeamEverySingleDay, MenoPosse, Peloton Digital App Users, etc.—any of which you can join. There's also a search bar, and you can search for Teams to join by activity type, location, or interest . Credit: Lindsey Ellefson You may not actually know these people, but they can motivate you to exercise the same way strangers at the gym do: Just by existing in your space, even your virtual space. How Peloton Teams keeps me moving I usually keep my Peloton profile set to private since I shared my username on my Instagram Stories when I first got my Bike and, as a result, I have a lot of strangers on my in-app friends list and I don't think they need to see a feed of how often I'm using my machine. For this reason, it felt a little unusual for me to share the details of my workout schedule with someone, even though my first Team just consisted of myself and my boyfriend. But after just a day or two of us working on a shared-goal challenge of completing a mere 10 workouts, I started feeling the motivating itch: If I didn't hop on my Bike, my beau would know—and I'd be letting our team down! Just the knowledge that my timely use of the Bike could help us reach our shared goal kept me active and excited to work out. I am also a deeply competitive person, and though we were doing a shared-goal challenge, not a head-to-head competition, it still delivered me a little dopamine shot to check my stats and discover that I did, in fact, beat him by contributing more to our goal over the course of the week-long challenge. The bottom line Anything that motivates a person to work out is a good thing in my book, but Peloton Teams is especially useful because it's so easy to set up, and so well integrated with the app you're probably already using. You don't have to coordinate schedules with anyone, since you don't have to be working out at the same time. All you need to do is tap a few buttons, invite teammates, and get going. I wasn't sure it would be for me, given I'm generally self-motivating when it comes to my workouts, but I quickly discovered it lit a fire under me like no solo routine schedule could. I've already launched a new challenge for my boyfriend and myself. I expect to win.",

You can get it for $59.99 (originally $79.99), an impressive value for the money. AOSU Solar Camera Security Outdoor 100% Wire-Free Security Cameras Wireless Outdoor for Home Surveillance with Fixed Solar Panel, 360° $59.99 at Amazon $79.99 Save $20.00 Get Deal Get Deal $59.99 at Amazon $79.99 Save $20.00 This camera is one of the best I've tested, and it's simple to install. You only need to mount it with some screws into the wall or column you want to keep eyes on. Ideally, you want to get direct sunlight in that spot. Mine has never run out of battery, even through the winter in Atlanta. While it can work without direct sunlight, it won't recharge the battery as fast. You can't move the solar panel around, so the placement has to be strategic. However, since the camera pans 360 degrees, the angle it's facing at setup is not important (just make sure it's facing the sun as much as possible). The app is the smoothest and most responsive I've used (compared to Reolink, Eufy, and Lorex). It has some nice features, like human tracking, which focuses the camera on a person who walks in the frame and follows them around. At night, it'll record in 2K resolution. There is no subscription fee, but you'll need an SD card for it. It's IP65 weatherproof and compatible with Alexa and Google Assistant. You can also set up alarms and it has a spotlight that activates at night with movement (nowhere near as strong as a spotlight, but enough to deter someone at night from a small porch).",

Right now, Amazon Prime members can get the Soundcore C30i Open Earbuds by Anker for 30% off. Available in black and white, they offer a more breathable alternative to over-ear headphones, allowing you to stay aware of your surroundings while listening to music. Soundcore C30i Open Earbuds by Anker $48.99 at Amazon $69.99 Save $21.00 Get Deal Get Deal $48.99 at Amazon $69.99 Save $21.00 The attachable ear grips help keep these clip-on headphones in place during intense workouts. While they’re only rated IPX4 for water resistance—meaning they’re sweat- and rainproof but not designed for full submersion—they hold up well for most active use. Despite the open-ear design, racetrack-style dynamic drivers provide clear sound. While the earbuds aren't the most bass-heavy headphones on the market, Amazon reviewers were surprised by the depth of the bass for the price point and the open-ear style, and a 3D surround setting on the EQ creates a more immersive listening experience. Battery life is another strong point, with up to 30 hours on a single charge. That said, fit varies by ear shape; while some find them comfortable to wear all day, others find them a bit snug, especially after prolonged use. At .19 ounces, they’re one of Anker’s lightest clip-on earbuds. Similar to bone conduction headphones, these don’t sit inside the ear canal. Unlike some bulkier models (like Shokz ), they're slim enough to wear comfortably with hats, glasses, or masks without interference. If you want to hear your surroundings while enjoying your music on a walk, bike ride, commute, or during a gym session, the C30i is worth considering. According to customer reviews, the Soundcore C30i Open Earbuds by Anker deliver strong performance for the current $50 price point, offering good value on a budget, especially in hot weather when over-ear headphones can feel stifling. However, if you’re looking for noise cancellation or plan to make frequent phone calls in noisy environments, you may want to explore alternative options.",

    "summary": "Spyware campaigns may be scanning your photo gallery for sensitive data.",
    "content": "If you keep screenshots of login credentials or cryptocurrency seed phrases—or any sensitive content, really—in your phone's photo gallery, you should go through and remove them. A spyware campaign targeting images is spreading through apps found on the Apple App and Google Play stores as well as third-party sources. Identified by Kaspersky and reported by Bleeping Computer , SparkKitty malware gains access to photo galleries on iOS and Android, allowing it to exfiltrate images or data contained within them, possibly with the goal of stealing victims' crypto assets as well as other compromising information. SparkKitty steals images and screenshots If SparkKitty infects your iOS device, it requests permission to access your photo gallery which, if granted, will allow the program to monitor for and exfiltrate new images. On Android, SparkKitty requests storage permissions to access images so that it can upload images along with device identifiers and metadata. It may also use Google ML Kit's optical character recognition (OCR) to specifically target images like screenshots that contain text. SparkKitty spreads through malicious apps that have been found (and subsequently removed) on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Kaspersky also discovered the malware in TikTok clones—distributed via unofficial platforms—that embed various fake apps, including cryptocurrency stores and gambling and casino apps. SparkKitty may be an iteration of SparkCat, a photo-scanning malware that was first identified earlier this year but had likely been circulating for some time. While SparkCat specifically targeted crypto wallets using OCR to identify text keywords, SparkKitty appears to indiscriminately steal images from compromised galleries. Since some SparkKitty delivery vectors have been crypto-themed, Kaspersky researchers believe crypto theft is still the primary goal, though the possibility of other sensitive content being used maliciously—extortion, for example—remains. What you need to do iOS and Android users can take steps both to minimize or protect the sensitive data stored on their devices as well as limit the risk of falling victim to spyware like SparkKitty in the first place. First and foremost, don't keep photos or screenshots of your crypto seed phrase, login credentials, or sensitive content of any kind in your photo gallery. Doing so puts your accounts at risk if your device is compromised in any way, whether by malware or physical theft. Regular logins can be locked in a password manager behind several layers of security. Your crypto seed phrase may be safest split into sections and stored offline. You should also exercise caution when downloading apps to your device, whether from the Google Play and Apple App stores or unofficial sources. Unfortunately, you can't trust everything you find even on vetted platforms. Look for red flags: Check the developer's history and scrutinize reviews, especially if there are a lot of glowing reviews relative to the number of downloads. Be wary of requests to access your photo gallery, especially if those permissions aren't related to the app's functionality. In fact, you should pay close attention to permissions requested any time you install a new app—don't just blindly allow them. Finally, ensure Google Play Protect, which has live threat detection , is active on Android, and keep an eye out for warning signs of a malware infection on your device.",

    "content": "Among the many features and changes included in iOS 26 are a series of helpful battery updates for your iPhone. There's a new charging indicator that appears at the top of the Lock Screen, to let you know how long it'll take to charge your phone to 80 or 100%; a redesigned Battery settings page, which gives you deeper insights into your battery health and usage; and, most notably, a new \"Adaptive Power\" feature, that can make small changes in your iPhone's performance to boost your battery life—like a light version of Low Power Mode. They might not be the flashiest of features, especially when to compared to Apple's \"Liquid Glass\" redesign , but they are quite useful. I don't know how it's taken Apple nearly two decades to add a charging estimate to the iPhone, as now you won't have to wonder how long it'll take before your phone has enough juice to leave the house. Adaptive Power, too, is great to have here, since Low Power Mode can take things too far in the name of reducing battery consumption. With this new feature, your iPhone will hopefully still feel as fast and snappy as usual, while lasting a bit longer between charges as well. There's only one problem here: Your iPhone might not actually be compatible with Adaptive Power, due to how the feature works under the hood. Adaptive Power is AI-powered In order to know when to reduce your iPhone's performance to extend battery life without a noticeable affect on iOS, Apple is tapping into its AI toolkit—Apple Intelligence. If you have an iPhone 15 or older, you know that your iPhone is not compatible with Apple Intelligence, even if the reasoning is a bit dubious . Nevertheless, Apple Intelligence features are limited to iPhone 15 Pro and newer, which really means there are only six iPhone models that can run them: iPhone 15 Pro iPhone 15 Pro Max iPhone 16 iPhone 16 Plus iPhone 16 Pro iPhone 16 Pro Max Unfortunately, as Adaptive Power uses AI to work, the feature is limited to this list of six devices. MacRumors confirms as much , after testing the battery feature in the first iOS 26 beta. It's far from the only new iOS 26 feature to be limited to these Apple Intelligence iPhones , too. New features like Live Translation, Visual Intelligence, and the new lens cleaning alert also use AI to function, and, as such, are not included on iOS 26 for older iPhones. iOS 26 may run on iPhone 11 or newer, but unless you have an iPhone 15 Pro or newer, you're not getting the full iOS 26 experience.",

The Galaxy Z Flip 6 is Samsung’s latest take on the foldable phone , and right now, the 256GB unlocked version is available for $949.99 on Amazon. That’s a $150 drop from its usual $1,099 list price. It’s still a premium phone , no doubt, but for anyone curious about foldables—or already sold on the style—this is one of the more polished versions we’ve seen so far. It keeps the same compact clamshell design while improving on durability, battery life, and AI-driven features. For more folding phone options, PCMag has a solid roundup worth browsing. And if you’re open to all kinds of Android phones, our 2025 guide to the best ones on the market is a great place to start. The phone folds in half to a satisfyingly slim square, which makes it feel less bulky in a pocket or bag than most modern flagships. The 6.7-inch inner screen is bright, sharp, and smooth with its 120Hz refresh rate . What’s new here is the hinge—it’s sturdier than previous generations and rated IP48 for dust and water resistance, which is a meaningful step up. Inside, you get a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip, 12GB of RAM, and a 4,000mAh battery, all of which translate into noticeably smoother performance and longer uptime compared to the last-gen Z Flip 5 . This PCMag review notes that it lasted over 16 hours in their video rundown test. There are still trade-offs. The crease in the middle is visible—less distracting than before, but it’s there. The outer display is handy for quick interactions and widgets, but is still too cramped for typing or anything beyond glancing at a message. And if photography is your top priority, the dual 12MP cameras do a good job, but they don’t quite match up to what you’d get on Samsung’s Ultra line. That said, the Flip 6 adds some fun AI tricks, like real-time translation during calls and the ability to auto-frame your selfies when using the hands-free mode. If you're considering alternatives, you might want to check out the 2024 Motorola Razr+ , currently discounted to $799 from its usual price of $999.",

And if you're okay with not having the latest, you might want to check out this guide to the best Wi-Fi 6 routers . The BE230 doesn’t have a 6GHz band or support for the widest (320MHz) channels, which are two of the more premium features of Wi-Fi 7. But if you don’t own devices that specifically use those features—which most people don’t—it’s not a huge loss. What you do get is fast dual-band performance, solid range for apartments or small homes, and handy extras like built-in parental controls and network protection. There’s a simple app (Tether) for setup, four LAN ports in the back, and support for mesh setups later if you want to expand coverage. Just note that some of the more advanced controls (like content filters or stronger malware protection) require a paid subscription , notes this PCMag review . If your current router is showing its age or struggling to keep up with multiple devices, the BE230 offers a decent step up without getting overly complicated. It’s not designed to be the most powerful router out there, but it does a good job of balancing speed, reliability, and cost. Just make sure you’re not expecting blazing-fast wifi in every corner of a huge house—this one’s best for everyday use in average-sized spaces.",

    "summary": "There is so much fake money flowing into fake charities to rescue fake dogs.",
    "content": "I'm fascinated with the fictional information infrastructure in which many of us (arguably all of us) live. The fake-news expanded universe encompasses everything from political propaganda, to conspiracy theories, religious beliefs (except the ones you hold, of course, which are totally true), and that thing your friend told you that time. Also: celebrity dog rescues . At the intersection of artificial intelligence and natural stupidity, the unholy spider that spins the giant web of lies in which we are imprisoned has determined that people want to read, click on, and otherwise engage with content involving celebrities who have donated millions to fund dog rescue operations. I don't know why. You don't know why. No one knows why. But that's where we are. The fake generosity leaderboard Here's a sample of recent fake stories about celebrity dog-lovers and their fake dog charities, in order of generosity. Peyton Manning : According to a June 16 Facebook post from \"Magic Clement,\" washed-up quarterback Peyton Manning bought an existing dog shelter called \"Maple Creek Rescue\" and fully refurbished it. Magic Clement didn't provide the monetary amount of Manning's donation, so I'm going to estimate $500,000 in fake money. This makes fake Peyton Manning a cheapskate among fake celebrity dog rescuers, but according to Magic Clement (a Facebook clearing house for AI-generated stories about Peyton Manning being a hero), Manning saved a different dog shelter just today, so he seems to be putting in the most fake effort, at least. For the record: No dog shelter called \"Maple Creek Rescue\" exists and the picture below is AI. Credit: Magic Clement/Facebook Eminem : A Facebook page dedicated to the once-controversial rapper proclaims that he made a $10 million investment in a \"paradise” for stray dogs. Probably just to make Peyton Manning look like a tool. Here's the picture from the Facebook post: Credit: Facebook Eagle-eyed readers will note that these images are AI-generated, especially the one at top right, in which Em seems to be wearing a Michael Vick jersey. Not a good look for a dog sanctuary owner. This story is not true either . Morgan Freeman : Presumably in an effort to one-up fake Eminem by a million fake bucks, fake Morgan Freeman recently donated $11 million to build a sanctuary for dogs on his 88th birthday. The Facebook post announcing the act of fake dog charity has been shared over 13,000 times, but contains no AI photos of Freeman. Luckily, another Facebook page, Rocky's K9 Rescue , stepped up and posted this: Credit: Facebook Obviously, Morgan Freeman has not donated $11 million to a dog charity. He did turn 88 on June 1, though. Josh Allen, Jose Altuve, Aidan Hutchinson, Dak Prescott : These athletes reportedly donated $20 million, each, to establish separate dog sanctuaries. Actually , they didn't donate anything, but it seems that $20 million is the going rate for athletes donating to dog sanctuaries. You'd think they'd pool their money and open one gigantic dog rescue center, just for efficiency. Jelly Roll : Fake Jelly Roll is the king of donating fake money to fake dog charities. I'm no financial expert, but I imagine that the country-rapper's net worth is much lower than Peyton Manning, Eminem, and Morgan Freeman, so his May 12 gift of $20 million \"to build a 'paradise' dedicated to rescuing stray dogs,\" is particularly generous, but he also d onated $20 mil on June 17 ! Jelly Roll, are you drunk? ( This is fake, of course, but Jelly Roll does own a dog .) The bottom line is, being a stray dog is a lucrative occupation in the fictional universe of Facebook pages your mom probably reads: Last month, fake celebrities donated $141,500,000 for dog sanctuaries, and that's just the ones I found before i got bored. Why are there so many fake dog charities? The \"why\" of fake dog stories is complicated, but their popularity isn't: People are emotional about dogs and they want celebrities to be heroes, so \"celebrity loves dogs!\" is going to catch attention. As long as none of the people who post or host this content cares about lying all the time, to everyone, there's a ton of \"engagement.\" But what do the creators of these pages get out of the attention they seek? Nobody is getting rich off these individual pages, and it's hard to see how some of them even make a pittance. Rocky's K9 Rescue, one of the Facebook pages that spread the fake Morgan Freeman story, says it's taking donations, which at least makes sense (Despite the name, Rocky's K9 Rescue doesn't seem to be connected to actual dog activist Rocky Kanaka . Make of that what you will.) One of the dozens of posts I looked at on the fake Jelly Roll page links to a t-shirt that seems related to the singer. Magic Clement 's motivations are more mysterious. How does posting an AI-generated story about Peyton Manning saving a library by bringing it books work as a business strategy? (How would bringing more books help keep a library open, for that matter?) Whatever is going on, somehow, at the end of the line, someone has to be making a buck. I'll assume it's Mark Zuckerberg. Actual celebrity dog philanthropists (probably) Meanwhile, in the real world, many non-fake celebrities have worked with and donated to animal charities that actually exist, including a few who seem to have started something like dog sanctuaries. Reality show personage Lisa Vanderpump founded Vanderpump Dog Foundation , which lists a \" dog nursery \" among its initiatives. Singer Miranda Lambert's Muttnation Foundation provides grants to animal shelters along with a bunch of other animal-related charitable giving. Singer Ariana Grande's Orange Twins Rescue lists a single dog for adoption on its site . But none of these real stories seem to have the legs of the fake ones. Maybe the money is too small—none of these charities approach $20 million. Naybe the stars aren't famous enough. But for whatever reason, they just don't pop. I checked these celebrity dog charities on Charity Navigator, and Grande's Orange Twins Rescue is not listed there (although it is a legitimate non-profit); MuttNation scored a solid 88% ; a \"good\" rating; and Vanderpump's foundation's is rated one out of four stars , or \"proceed with caution.\" Why does this even matter? With the world's information pipes flooded with fake everything, some sleaze making a fraction of a fraction of a cent by telling lies about Morgan Freeman's charitable work seems like a nothingburger. But it matters. Fake dog charity stories are only a tiny part of a massive worldwide experiment to test what happens to a culture when everything anyone sees, reads, or hears is fake. And you're the lab rat. It's the erosion of shared reality, a complete abandonment of the loose consensus we used to have about the truth—and the worst part is, there's no one driving the train. I wish there were a shadowy cabal of moneymen brainwashing us for nefarious ends. At least then there'd be a purpose. Instead, our ever-fragile grip on reality is being dissolved by cretins whose greatest life achievement is tricking dummies on Facebook into buying unofficial Jelly Roll t-shirts.",

It has many of the same features as more well-known competitors and has a 8000Pa suction power that works on both carpeting and hard flooring, with a carpet recognition function that can remove stains.

It takes just eight minutes to map your space, and its 5200mAh battery can last up to 300 minutes on a single charge. The vacuum is controlled via an app that lets you choose from multiple modes, controlling factors like suction strength, water volume, and dual cleaning modes. While being able to control the device from an app is convenient, some users find it inconsistent and buggy, encountering issues with the app's setup and connection. Despite this, Amazon reviewers who also own Roombas and iRobots say they’re equally impressed by the C12’s cleaning performance. While it’s a versatile cleaning device, there are a couple of drawbacks. It doesn’t self-clean or auto-empty, and a few reviewers mention that it can get stuck on thresholds between rooms. The mopping function also leans towards more superficial surface cleaning or daily upkeep rather than the deep scrubbing power of pricier models. Overall, the Yeedi C12 Robot Vacuum Cleaner and Mop offers powerful suction, smart navigation, and customizable cleaning at a fraction of the cost of premium alternatives, making it a decently priced budget buy. If you’re looking to upgrade , the C12 Pro Plus is currently just $100 more and highly rated by reviewers.",

    "link": "https://lifehacker.com/tech/build-a-smart-home-that-wont-always-be-listening?utm_medium=RSS",
    "summary": "You don't need to let these companies listen to you 24/7 in order to have a few convenient gadgets.",
    "content": "We may earn a commission from links on this page. The very first time I turned off my bedroom lights from under the covers, I was sold on smart home tech. There's just one problem: This trick relies on putting a device that's always listening for an activation phrase in a room where you might not want to risk an accidental recording. If that's been a speed bump for you, don't worry: There are ways to build a smart home without all the microphones. Listening isn't all it's cracked up to be Before we get into how to avoid always-listening smart speakers, it's worth briefly addressing the actual privacy concern. It's easy (and very common) to get freaked out when you have a conversation about something specific, only to be served ads for that very thing a few hours later. This kind of thing has led to the common misconception that phones, tablets, and yes, smart speakers are recording everything you say to serve you ads. This isn't true, but the truth is worse . In reality, smart speakers are \"always listening,\" but for a specific wake word. Until that word is detected locally, no audio recording is being sent to an external server. If a device were sending audio recordings of everything you say back home, it would actually be pretty easy to detect by how much data these devices use on your network . That doesn't mean there are zero privacy issues, though. Smart speakers can activate by mistake, potentially as often as once an hour . A few seconds of recording every hour isn't the same as constant surveillance, but if you don't want to risk accidentally recording a particularly sensitive few seconds, here are some alternatives. Use smart displays for full-home control While most smart displays also come with always-listening microphones, these can usually be disabled. What you're left with is a screen that you can customize with plenty of smart home controls that let you adjust lights, play music, or watch videos. And in my experience, they're worth the money even without a voice assistant. Most smart displays like the Google Nest Hub or the Amazon Echo Show have physical switches that will disable the microphone. This prevents any audio recordings, even locally, so you don't have to worry about accidental triggers or software updates that turn it back on. Personally, I still use a Lenovo Smart Display that, while no longer getting updates , has a physical slider to block the camera as well. With the more surveillance-like elements disabled, what you're left with is a screen with shortcuts to control all of your smart gadgets. My Google smart display, for example, has an always-available shortcut for the kitchen lights, but it's a swipe away to controls for all the other rooms in the house. It's also a handy way to let everyone in the home tweak scenes and adjust the color of lights without needing to give everyone access to a full smart light app. Customize your smartphone with even more shortcuts Smart displays are nice for one central control unit, but the convenience of voice-activated assistants is that you can reach them from anywhere. But why would you need that if your phone is already glued to your hand anyway? Most of us, most of the time, probably don't need much more than a phone to control an entire smart home. Android and iOS both support customizable smart home widgets, even from your lock screen. The process will be a little different for every manufacturer, but with a little tweaking you can give yourself a panel to quickly turn on or off every gadget you own. Home screen widgets are often even more customizable. I've used Philips Hue lights for years , so I have a collection of shortcuts from the Hue app on a page of my home screen. However, the Google Home app also has its own shortcuts widget that you can customize with whole-room control that encompasses multiple different device categories. So, however you prefer to control your devices, there are options. Use voice commands on your phone that you control It's not necessarily the \"listening\" part that bothers most people, but the \"always\" part. Fortunately, you don't need to give up on voice controls entirely, if you're willing to use your phone instead of a smart speaker. Gemini on Android and Siri on iOS both support smart home commands, and usually the exact same ones that you would use on their respective smart speakers anyway. On Android in particular, the experience is kind of better. See, right now, Google's suite of smart speakers and displays are still stuck with Google Assistant . It's a clunkier, more finicky voice control scheme. Gemini, on the other hand, has a much better understanding of both time as well as natural-language commands. You can set Gemini to be your default voice assistant on Android (it might even already be the default) and use it to control your smart home's devices. You might need to open Gemini's settings and head to Apps > Device Control to enable Google Home, but once you do, you can instruct Gemini to control your smart home gadgets. Gemini's 'Saved Info' feature is also a handy tool for tying multiple commands together into a single shortcut. You can still use a smart speaker without the microphone Smart speakers are also, you know, speakers. They can play music, sound alarms, or broadcast messages between rooms. Most of them don't have to always listen to you, either. If you like the convenience of voice commands, but still want your privacy, use that little mute button we mentioned earlier—that doesn't just apply to smart displays. There are a lot of good reasons to build your smart home with devices that might have some privacy implications, but it's not an all-or-nothing situation. In the early days, a lot of smart home gadgets might have made privacy an afterthought, but nowadays, you have a lot more control over when and how your devices listen to you.",

    "link": "https://lifehacker.com/tech/your-iphone-is-getting-a-new-ringtone?utm_medium=RSS",
    "summary": "Want to hear it early?",
    "content": "Despite a lengthy WWDC keynote , Apple didn't have time to advertise each and every new feature shipping with iOS 26 . As such, we continue to learn about new features and smaller changes as beta testers explore the new OS. These testers have sniffed out one new addition that is small, but fun: Your iPhone is getting a new ringtone . Technically, it's getting a different version of an existing ringtone. At least, that's how Apple apparently sees things: Following the release of iOS 26 beta 2 , Apple has, for the first time, added an alternate version of one of its signature ringtones—specifically, \"Reflection,\" the default iOS ringtone that Apple originally introduced with the iPhone X . Provided Apple doesn't change things between now and the release of the final version of iOS 26, once you've upgraded you'll find a drop down arrow next to \"Reflection\" in your phone's ringtones settings. Tap that, and you'll see two options: \"Default,\" which is the familiar tone, and \"Alt 1.\" That's your new ringtone. What's perhaps more interesting than the tone itself is the fact that keen beta observers actually found it buried in the first beta for iOS 26: While Alt 1 wasn't an option in the Ringtones settings, the sound file itself was present in the IPSW file for the operating system, as this X user discovered on June 18. You can hear the ringtone itself in the embedded post: This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed. I do hear similarities between the Alt 1 and Default versions of Reflection, but, to be honest, Alt 1 sounds unique enough to my ear to deserve its own entry. Apple could have called this \"Rumination\" or \"Refraction\" or anything really, and I don't think many would have complained that it sounded too close to the existing default ringtone. To be fair, though, Alt 1 is a pretty cool name for a ringtone. And who knows—Apple could change the name or make it a separate entry before the OS is officially released. It could also add more alternate tones, or delete Alt 1 entirely. We won't know until the final version of iOS 26 rolls out this fall.",

    "content": "We may earn a commission from links on this page. Deal pricing and availability subject to change after time of publication. If you're looking for an easy-to-install outdoor security solution that won’t rack up monthly fees, the eufy Security SoloCam S220 2-Cam Pack is a solid pick, especially while it's on sale for $200. The bundle includes two solar-powered, wire-free outdoor cameras that have crisp 2K resolution, infrared-enhanced night vision in low-light settings, dual connection options, and built-in AI. They self-charge off as little as three hours of sunshine daily to operate continuously, and have up to a three-month battery backup. eufy Security SoloCam S220 2-Cam Pack $199.00 at Amazon $229.99 Save $30.99 Get Deal Get Deal $199.00 at Amazon $229.99 Save $30.99 Beyond the ability to self-charge, one major perk is that they don’t require a monthly paid subscription or have any recurring monthly fees. This eufy cam records locally with 8 GB of storage (roughly two weeks' worth). The AI feature is also helpful in minimizing false alarms from movement generated by pets, cars, or trees, and only detects humans walking in the vicinity. Amazon reviewers appreciate the ease of installation, footage quality at all hours, and the long, powerful signal range. These compact cameras can be used together or separately as standalone units. As with most outdoor security cameras, this model has an IP67 rating, making it 100% weatherproof for year-round usage, along with two-way audio that lets you talk to delivery people or ward off unwanted guests directly from the eufy app. However, there are some tradeoffs. Color night vision isn’t available, and the camera operates on 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi only, which may be an issue on crowded networks. While it technically supports Alexa and Google Assistant, features like facial recognition, built-in sirens, or expanded storage require pairing with a separate HomeBase 3 hub. Also, changing wifi networks means manually resetting the device every time. Still, if you’re looking for outdoor surveillance without the hassle of recharging or battery swaps and you don’t require the full bells and whistles of more advanced models like the PC Mag-vetted eufy SoloCam S340 (i.e, panning and tilting), this is a value-friendly choice at 13% off.",

    "content": "The following content is brought to you by Lifehacker partners. If you buy a product featured here, we may earn an affiliate commission or other compensation. Having a pool is awesome when it comes to summertime dips and backyard parties, but creating a smashing vibe—and keeping your pool sparkling clean—can be a lot of work. And who wants to work when it’s scorching hot and you have a pool? Nobody. These simple tips will help you dial in your poolside game and get you ready for all the hangs and Marco Polo games ahead. Make some shade The sun’s rays are no joke and it’s important to set up a UV-resistant patio umbrella (or two) for those all-day hangs. If you have a patio table, it likely already has a hole in the middle for an umbrella. A stand-alone cantilevered umbrella also works well if you want to throw shade over a couple of chaises. Look for a sturdy, heavy base and crank-and-tilt mechanisms, so that you can move the umbrella with the sun. Let the robots do the dirty work Credit: Beatbot Nobody wants to swim in a dirty pool, so why not let an AI-powered cleaning robot, like the Beatbot AquaSense 2 Ultra , keep it clean for you? The cordless Beatbot AquaSense 2 Ultra not only looks slick, but it’s the only robotic pool cleaner with HybridSense Pool Mapping. This advanced system utilizes 27 sensors—including an AI camera and ultrasonic and infrared sensors—to map your pool’s unique layout, scan for debris, and clean like a champ. The Beatbot slays at surface skimming, waterline scrubbing, floor cleaning, wall scrubbing, and keeping your pool cannonball-ready. Basically, this busy bot and its handy mobile app will keep your pool clean without the cords, hassle, or time suck. AquaSense 2 Ultra at Beatbot Shop Now Shop Now at Beatbot Just drop it in and it cleans for up to 10 hours on one charge. Once it’s finished, it returns to the surface near your pool’s edge and releases water in order to float. It’s a cinch to retrieve. Keep your water sparkling Yet another perk of the Beatbot AquaSense 2 Ultra: It features an exclusive ClearWater Clarification System that automatically dispenses an eco-friendly water clarifier made from recycled crab shells. The natural solution binds gunk into larger clumps, allowing it to sink to the bottom of your pool, where it’s detected and sucked up by the Beatbot. Water wings for all your friends Keep your pool party-ready by assembling a toy collection that includes big, colorful beach balls, a floating mattress or inflatable chair for lazy lounging, and why not throw in a sparkly unicorn floatie? Water wings are a smart idea if you plan on having kids over at any point. Bendable pool noodles are awesome, too, as you can float on them, use them in your water-aerobics workout, and more . Balance your levels Keeping your pool’s chlorine and pH levels balanced is essential, especially if you have kids and lots of friends using your pool. If the acidity or alkaline level is too high or low, it can cause nasty skin irritations and decrease the effectiveness of the chlorine, which is a pool-party foul. Keeping the balance in check is easy. Just use a pool kit or strip that measures both the chlorine and pH levels. Test your water every day at the beginning of summer, and once you get the numbers where you want them (pH levels should land between 7.2 and 7.8 and chlorine between 1.0 and 3.0 parts per million), a quick test twice a week is all you need. Stock up on snacks and bevs Because you never know when thirsty friends are going to drop in for a dip, you want to always have light refreshments on hand. Keep a separate minifridge somewhere near the pool, if possible, and keep it stocked with frosty beverages for all ages. It’s also a good idea to have chips, crackers, and other hunger-busters ready. Summer’s here, and it’s time to prep for the poolside hangs and pool parties ahead. Keep calm and splash on by utilizing a stress-free routine that includes the Beatbot AquaSense 2 Ultra , and spend your summer enjoying your pool, instead of maintaining it.",

    "summary": "An unknown number of policyholders may have had their sensitive information stolen in the attack.",
    "content": "Customers who have insurance through Aflac may have had their data stolen. Earlier this month, the company experienced a cyber attack that compromised personal information belonging to an unknown number of its approximately 50 million policyholders. Aflac is just the latest in a string of insurance and healthcare companies targeted by cyber actors. The group believed to be behind this incident is also reportedly responsible for recent hacks at Philadelphia Insurance Companies and Erie Indemnity. In the last year or so, major breaches have also been reported at Landmark Admin and Blue Shield of California , among others. How the Aflac data leak happened Aflac hasn't disclosed many specifics of the cyber incident, which occurred on June 12, other than to say that the \"unauthorized party\" utilized social engineering to hack into the company's network. These tactics may have included scamming help desks to reset login credentials and bypass multifactor authentication, according to a security expert interviewed by Reuters . Aflac has said that the attack lasted several hours and did not involve ransomware. The compromised data may have included claim information, health information, Social Security numbers, and other \"personal information\" belonging to Aflac customers, beneficiaries, agents, and employees. What to do if your data was compromised As Aflac has not determined how many customers were affected by the breach, the company does not appear to be notifying individuals directly at this time. However, if you are an Aflac policyholder, you can contact the company's call center to receive 24 months of free credit monitoring, identity theft protection, and Medical Shield, which specifically focuses on medical and healthcare data that may be at risk of exposure or fraud. According to Aflac's press release describing the incident, any customer who calls is eligible for these services. The call center is open Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. ET, Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. ET, and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. ET through the end of June (so you should call ASAP). The number is 855-361-0305. Otherwise, the usual precautions following a data breach apply: Keep an eye on your credit report ( request a free copy each week ) and financial statements—whether you have credit monitoring and identity theft protection set up or not—for signs of unusual activity. You can go ahead and freeze your credit and place a fraud alert on your file. Be wary of unsolicited communication that could be phishing attempts, and never click links, open attachments, or engage in any way with texts, emails, or phone calls from anyone you don't know. You should also proceed with caution if you receive any messages or notices specifically related to your Aflac account: never provide sensitive information to anyone who contacts you out of the blue, and always go directly to the website to log in or access your information.",

    "link": "https://lifehacker.com/money/walmart-deals-sale-is-walmarts-answer-to-prime-day?utm_medium=RSS",
    "summary": "The six-day sale features deals on electronics, home goods, toys, and more.",
    "content": "We may earn a commission from links on this page. Deal pricing and availability subject to change after time of publication. Walmart announced that it's prepping to launch Walmart Deals , a sale meant to compete with Prime Day . Last year, Walmart had the same sale around last year's Prime Day as well, so it's no surprise it's happening again. Here is what you can expect from Walmart Deals. What is Walmart Deals? Walmart Deals is meant to be the answer to Amazon's Prime Day. It is both an in-store and online sale with deals on most things that Walmart sells (food being arguably the biggest omission). The sale happens every year around these early summer dates, revolving around Prime Day. When does Walmart Deals start? Walmart Deals kicks off online at 12 a.m. ET on Tuesday, July 8, and in stores at local opening times, and it will run through Sunday, July 13. This is the first time the sale will run for six days, likely having to do with Amazon also extending its sale . Do you need to be a Walmart+ member to shop during Walmart Deals? No. But, if you are a Walmart+ member, you'll get early access to the sales beginning Tuesday, July 7 at 7 p.m. ET, a full night before the event opens to the public. You can sign up for a free 30-day Walmart+ subscription or get the annual plan for $98 ($8.17/month). What you can expect from Walmart Deals Walmart says its sale will include many different categories, including deals on electronics, home, toys, travel, back-to-school materials, and many other categories—similar to the deals we found last year . The sale will be on Walmart.com , the Walmart app, and in stores. You can already see the landing page, even though the sale hasn't started. Here are some deals Walmart says will be available: 32-Inch Samsung Smart Monitor for $199 (was $299.99) 50-Inch Vizio QLED Smart TV for $238 (was $298) Dyson V7 Advanced Cordless Vacuum Cleaner for $229.99 (was $399.99) HART 40-Volt 21-inch Supercharge 3-in-1 Self-Propelled Mower Kit for $374 (was $548) Ozark Trail 20x10 Foot Straight Leg Pop Up Canopy Tent for $139.77 (was $199.67) Seiko Automatic Blue Dial Stainless Steel Men's Watch for $125 (was $196.20) Timex Women's Dress Crystal 30mm Watch for $32.25 (was $79) Skylight 15 inch All in one Family Calendar for $269.99 (was $319.99) 75-Inch DIY Nutcracker for $159 (special buy, pre-order) 55-Inch DIY Gingerbread House for $100 (special buy, pre-order) You can choose between in-store pickup and different delivery options, including early-morning delivery, late-night express delivery, and next- and two-day shipping. Here are all of the other competing sales You can always expect major retailers to have their own competitive sales, the big ones being Best Buy , Target, and, of course, Amazon . Like in previous years, the dates for these sales will start earlier, overlap, and run longer than Prime Day. There are usually a couple of deals that are better than Amazon's Prime Day from each of the retailers, but the majority of the good deals will be on Amazon. I will be updating this post with details on those offerings as soon as they've been announced.",

    "link": "https://lifehacker.com/tech/ios-26s-second-beta-tones-down-the-liquid-glass-effect?utm_medium=RSS",
    "summary": "Control Center is visible once more.",
    "content": "iOS 26 is full of new features and changes (some of which your older iPhone might not see ), but perhaps the most obvious change this year is Apple's \" Liquid Glass \" redesign. The goal is to turn all of the on-screen elements into digital glass: When you place something behind those elements, you should still be able to see it, just obscured and blurred, as a real object may appear behind a piece of glass. The new update is currently in the initial stages of beta testing , which means Apple is still ironing out all of the quirks and issues before iOS 26 goes public later this year. However, even in this early stage, not everyone is a fan of Liquid Glass. Critiques can vary, but in general, the biggest controversy surrounds visibility: When you access Control Center in this first beta, for example, the tiles let through so much of the background that it can be difficult to quickly find the option you want to select. (Even if you can see the tiles well enough, it just looks busy.) Soon after these critiques went viral on social media, beta testers discovered a workaround through an existing accessibility feature: \" Reduce Transparency .\" Reduce Transparency is meant to boost the contrast of on-screen elements by limiting or eliminating iOS' or macOS' transparent effects. As it happens, it also works on Liquid Glass, making Control Center tiles (and other UI elements) much more visible when placed on top of other items. As it happens, you might not need to rely on this feature once Apple rolls out iOS 26 in full. The company dropped the second iOS 26 beta on Monday, and with it, reduced the transparency of the Control Center tiles by default. You can see the difference in the example below, per MacRumors : This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed. It's a good sign that Apple is taking feedback seriously and working on a better implementation of its new design, though I'm a bit torn. The new look is more legible off the bat, but directly comparing it to the previous design, you definitely lose that Liquid Glass effect. Maybe the company will continue to refine it throughout the beta process. After all, it's still quite early, as the public beta doesn't drop until July, and the general release won't be until the fall.",
